One to ensure the school provides your child with <span>a free appropriate public education</span>, that includes special education and related services designed to meet your child's unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living. Second, to build a healthy working relationship with school personnel. \n      </p>\n\n      <h2>A note to special educators.</h2> \n        <p>\n        If emotions are under control on both sides, you will find it easier to work with parents, who learn the law. These parents want their children to learn. They want you to succeed. When parents document events and agreements, help their teams stay on task, and build strong working relationships with school personnel, everyone wins. Especially the children.\n        </p>\n\n\n      <h2>Step One. Request to have your child tested for an IEP.</h2> \n      <p>\n        The school needs to get your written permission to test your child. At the very least you will need to sign a release. There could be other documents you need to fill out as well. Ask for copies of everything.\n        If you get pushback from the front desk, just ask them for the documents that you need to fill out so you can get started on them.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Step Two. Get Organized. </h2>\n      <p>\n        Having documentation at your fingertips is vital. You want to get organized and stay organized.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Step Three. Test Your Child. </h2>\n      <p>\n        You want to have independent evaluations done as well.\n      </p>\n  \n      <h2>Step Four. Meet with the school.</h2>\n      <p>\n        Discuss and review the tests.\n        Understand what the different tests are.\n        Understand the results of the tests.\n        Determine significance of the results, what does this mean for your child?\n        Gather feedback from medical team to identify the child’s needs.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There might be pushback from the school that the child doesn’t qualify for an IEP. \n        Kow the eligibility criteria for an IEP (statutory, regulatory, & case law)\n        What are the local laws, and school board policies?\n        What other pertinent information do you need to know about eligabiilty\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Step Five. What is an IEP?</h2>\n      <p>\n        What to expect in the IEP meeting\n        Understand what your role is and what you bring to the table\n        Then we can talk about testing, subject matter expertise, project management, etc \n        What the agenda should be, the purpose of the meeting(s)?\n        How frequently are they going to be held?\n      </p>  \n      \n      <h2>Step Six. Managing Your IEP Meeting</h2>\n        Peparing for your first IEP meeting\n        Project Management.\n        RACI Matrix.\n        SMART IEP Goals and OKRs.\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"names":["title","name","content","property","rel","href","S","src","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
