## Breath

Many parents of children with ADHD find themselves feeling frustrated and exhausted when it comes to negotiating with the school. 
It can be an ordeal to try to get the accommodations that your child needs in order to be successful. Some parents give up and decide that it's not worth the fight. 
However, other parents prevail and are able to get the accommodations that their child needs. What makes the difference? Research, planning, and preparation. 
If you take the time to research what accommodations are available for students with ADHD, you will be better prepared to make a case for why your child needs them. 
You will also be more likely to have a successful outcome if you take the time to plan and prepare for your meeting with the school. 
Disability is a natural part of the human experiance and in no way diminishes your child's right to participate in and contribute to society - know what you want and be ready to fight for it. With a little bit of effort, you can make sure that your child gets the accommodations he or she needs to be successful in school.

## The Three Hats You Wear

As the parent of a child with ADHD, you will find yourself wearing many different hats. Often, you will be called upon to be a subject matter expert, providing information and support to teachers, therapists, and other professionals who are working with your child. Additionally, you will play the role of advocate, ensuring that your child's needs. Finally, you may also find yourself taking on the role of project manager, coordinating services and creating systems to help your IEP team succeed. Each of these roles requires a different set of skills, but all are essential in supporting your child's success. With a little knowledge and a lot of dedication, you can wear all three hats with ease.

**Subject Matter Expert.** Learn about your child's ADHD and how ADHD affects your child's ability to learn. How does it affect your child specifically: their learning, appropriate educational remediation techniques, & measuring educational progress. Learn the laws that apply to your child's situation. There is statutory, regulatory, & case law that you will need to know. Learn from other parents, school personal, and other advocates.

**Advocate.** You are the natural advocate for your child. There are different types of advocates: lay advocates, educational advocates, school personnel, and parents. Lay advocates use their specialized knowledge and expertise to help parents resolve problems with schools. Educational advocates evaluate children with disabilities and make recommendations about services. When educational advocates go to eligibility and IEP meetings they are acting on the child's behalf. Don't underestimate yourself. Parents are natural advocates for their children.

As a case manager, I have had the opportunity to advocate on behalf of a variety of families navigating a network of bureaucracy to obtain appropriate services. In my experience, one of the biggest challenges families face is getting accommodations for students with ADHD. Too often, students with ADHD are placed in regular education classrooms without the support they need to be successful. As a result, they can quickly fall behind and become frustrated and discouraged. I have seen firsthand the difference that accommodations can make for students with ADHD. When they have the supports they need, they are able to thrive in school and reach their full potential. I believe all students with ADHD deserve access to accommodations that will allow them to succeed.

**Project Manager.** Managing an IEP can feel like a daunting task, but with a bit of planning and organization, it can be manageable - and even enjoyable! The key is to break the project down into smaller tasks, and then create a plan of action for each task. For example, if one of your goals is to get accommodations for students with ADHD, you might create a task list that includes researching accommodations, reaching out to experts, and writing goals. By taking things one step at a time, you can make the process of managing an IEP much less overwhelming. And, by focusing on results, you can ensure that your efforts are effective and impactful. 

## Outline

### Start Here
The first step is to request an IEP evaluation from your schoo. An IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is a document that outlines accommodations and other supports that will be put in place to help your child succeed in school. Accommodations for adhd can include things like extra time for tests, preferential seating, and breaks during class. They are based on each child's unique needs and are meant to ensure your childâ€™s access to a free appropriate public education. Accommodations for students with adhd can make a big difference in their ability to learn and succeed in school. Don't hesitate to ask for an IEP evaluation if you think your child may benefit from one.

### Organization Tips for the Busy Parent
The next most critical thing you need to do after you request your child be tested for ADHD is to get organized. In this section we will cover how to get organized and what accommodations you can request for your child. Half the battle is already won through organization and preparation. This isn't a prerequisite to the work at hand . . . this is the work at hand. As a part of your organization, you will research accommodations for ADHD students. These accommodations can help your child in the classroom and in their everyday life. By being prepared and organized, you are giving your child the best chance to succeed.

### Why an IEP May Be Better Than a 504 Plan for Your ADHD Elemetary Student
This section will help you get up the learning curve on subject matter expertise. In this section we discuss IEPs, 504s, and the differences. I've created specific sections for each of them. IEPs stands for Individualized Education Plans and are created by a team which includes medical personnel, educators, parents, and the student when that student needs more support than what the school can provide in its general education setting.  IEPs are mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and are designed to ensure a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities so they can have access to education comparable to their non-disabled peers. A 504 Plan is designed to help children with disabilities so they can have access to education comparable to their non-disabled peers but unlike IEPs,504 plans are not mandated by IDEA, but by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Both IEPs and 504 plans lay out accommodations and modifications which will be implemented in order for the student to be successful in school. When it comes to ADHD specifically, IEPs and 504 plans can both be used to ensure that students with ADHD receive the necessary accommodations.I've created specific sections for each of them:
- IEPs for ADHD
- 504 Plans for ADHD

### How to Be An Effective Project Manager for Your Child's IEP Team
Goal setting is essential to the success of any project. Without clear goals, it is difficult to know what needs to be done and how to prioritize tasks. When creating an IEP for an elementary student with ADHD, goal setting is especially important. This is because the IEP will be used to track the student's progress and ensure that they are making adequate progress. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting goals for an IEP. First, goals should be specific and measurable. Second, they should be realistic and achievable. Third, they should be time-bound, so that there is a clear deadline for reaching the goal. Finally, goals should be relevant to the student's needs and interests. By keeping these things in mind, you can set goals that will help your student succeed. This next section focuses on project management topics around setting goals. Later when you create an IEP half the work is setting goals. Topics include:
- IEP Team Members, Roles, and Responsibilities

Because of this, it is important to have a solid understanding of ADHD and how it can affects students in the classroom.

### What Every Parent of an ADHD Child Should Know About Their Legal Rights

Under IDEA, students with ADHD are eligible for special education services and accommodations. These services and accommodations are designed to help students with ADHD succeed in school.
