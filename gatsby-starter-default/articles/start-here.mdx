Accomodations for ADHD and other resources to develop accommodations for ADHD elementary students, thier parents, and teachers.

"

---
Negotiating with the school is frustrating and debilitating for many parents of students with ADHD. It can be an ordeal to try to get the accommodations that your child needs in order to be successful. Some parents give up resigned to make do with what they have. However, other parents prevail and are able to get the accommodations that their child needs. 

What makes the difference? Research, planning, and preparation. If you take the time to research possible accommodations for students with ADHD, you will be better prepared to make a case for why your child needs them. You can secure a successful outcome if you take the time to plan and prepare for your meeting with the school. 

Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes your child's right to participate in and contribute to society. Know exactly what you want and be ready to fight for it. With a little bit of effort, you can make sure that your child gets the accommodations or ADHD they need.

## The Three Hats You Wear

You wear a variety of hats as the parent of an ADHD elementary student. You,  as a subject-matter expert, provide information and support to instructors, therapists, and other professionals who work with your child. You play the role of advocate, ensuring your child's needs. Finally, you also find yourself taking on the role of project manager, coordinating services, and creating systems to help your IEP team succeed. Each of these roles requires a different set of skills, but all are essential in supporting your child's success. With a little knowledge and a lot of dedication, you can wear all three hats with ease.

**Subject Matter Expert.**  Learn about your child's ADHD and how it affects their learning. What effect does it have on your kid specifically: their learning, educational remediation methods, and measuring educational progress? You'll need to understand the rules that apply to your child's situation. Statutory, regulatory, and case law are all required reading. Learn from other parents, educators, and advocates.

**Advocate.** You are the natural advocate for your child. Lay advocates, educational advocates, school employees, and parents are among the many types of advocates. Lay advocates use their specialized knowledge and expertise to help parents resolve problems with schools. Lay Advocates assist parents in resolving issues with schools. A Lay Advocate is an advocate who specializes in particular aspects of education, such as family life, academic performance, and extracurricular activities. Educational advocates evaluate children with disabilities and make recommendations about services. At eligibility and IEP meetings, educational advocates are representing the interests of the kid. Parents are natural advocates for their children. Don't underestimate yourself. 

I believe all students with ADHD deserve access to accommodations that will allow them to succeed. As a case manager, I've had the chance to advocate on behalf of many families navigating a network of bureaucracy to obtain appropriate services. In my experience, one of the biggest challenges families face is getting accommodations for students with ADHD. Students with ADHD are frequently placed in regular education classrooms without the support they require to be successful. They fall behind and become frustrated and discouraged. I've seen first-hand how accommodations help students with ADHD. When they have the supports they need, they are able to thrive in school and reach their full potential. 

**Project Manager.** Managing an IEP can feel like a daunting task, but with a bit of planning and organization, it can be manageable - and even enjoyable! The key is to break the project down into smaller tasks, and then create a plan of action for each task. For example, if one of your goals is to get accommodations for students with ADHD, you might create a task list that includes researching accommodations, reaching out to experts, and writing goals. By taking things one step at a time, you can make the process of managing an IEP much less overwhelming. And, by focusing on results, you can ensure that your efforts are effective and impactful. 

## A Brief on What Is Covered In These Next Sections

There is a lot to learn but you don't need to learn it all to start. This summary concentrates on the tasks you must accomplish and what you can start doing right now. You will have an overview of each action step so you can be confident that you know what you need when you need it. It's set up to find information quickly.

### Start Here

Step one, request an IEP evaluation from your school. An IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is a document that outlines accommodations and other supports to help your child succeed in school. Accommodations for ADHD can include things like extra time for tests, preferential seating, and breaks during class. They are based on each child's unique needs and are meant to ensure your childâ€™s access to a free appropriate public education. Accommodations for students with ADHD can make a big difference in their ability to learn and succeed in school. Don't hesitate to ask for an IEP evaluation if you think your child may benefit from one. Topics in this section include:

- Requesting Testing for an IEP: Why It's Important and How to Do It
- IEP Testing Process
- IEP Evaluation Tests
- IEP Psychological Tests

In a future section, we will talk about the differences between an IEP and a 504 plan and why an IEP may be better for your ADHD elementary student. For now, just request your child be tested for an IEP. You will always be able to fall back to a 504 Plan if you do that.

### Organization Tips for the Busy Parent

The next most critical thing you need to do after you request your child be tested for ADHD is to get organized. Half the battle is already won through organization and preparation. This isn't a prerequisite to the work at hand . . . this is the work at hand. In this section, we will cover how to get organized. 

An advantage of organizing your information is that you'll have a clearer view of things. IEPs are by nature short-term. When you can take in a 40,000 foot view of everything you will know where to focus and what to fight for. By being prepared and organized, you are giving your child and the IEP team the best chance to succeed.

### Why an IEP May Be Better Than a 504 Plan for Your ADHD Elementary Student

It's time to start making some progress up the learning curve on subject matter expertise. In this section, we discuss IEPs, 504s, and the differences. I've created specific sections for each of them. IEP stands for Individualized Education Plans and is created when that student needs more support than what the school can provide in its general education setting. It is put together by a team that includes medical personnel, educators, parents, and the student. 

IEPs are mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and are designed to ensure a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities so they can have access to education comparable to their non-disabled peers. 

A 504 Plan is designed to help children with disabilities so they can have access to education comparable to their non-disabled peers but unlike IEPs, 504 plans are not mandated by IDEA, but by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 

Both IEPs and 504 plan layout accommodations and modifications that will be implemented in order for the student to be successful in school. When it comes to ADHD specifically, IEPs and 504 plans can both be used to ensure that students with ADHD receive the necessary accommodations.

### How to Be An Effective Project Manager for Your Child's IEP Team

By now, this might all seem like a firehose. It is. In the following pages we'll slow down and take things one at a time.

Goal setting is essential to the success of an IEP. A large component of the IEP is setting goals. Without clear goals, it is difficult to know what needs to be done and how to prioritize tasks. The IEP will be used to track the student's progress and ensure that they are making adequate progress. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting goals for an IEP. First, goals should be specific and measurable. Second, they should be realistic and achievable. Third, they should be time-bound, so that there is a clear deadline for reaching the goal. Finally, goals should be relevant to the student's needs and interests. By keeping these things in mind, you can set goals that will help your student succeed. This next section focuses on project management topics around setting goals. Topics include:

- IEP Team Members, Roles, and Responsibilities
- Develop Page One

### The Top 10 Things You Should Know About ADHD

In this section, we circle back to building subject matter expertise specifically about ADHD in the classroom. As noted earlier, ADHD is a condition that can have a significant impact on academic performance. Because of this, it is important to have a solid understanding of ADHD and how it can affect students in the classroom. There are a number of strategies that can be employed to help students with ADHD succeed in school, but it is important to tailor these approaches to the individual needs of each student. With patience and creativity, teachers can provide students with ADHD the support they need to thrive academically. Topics include:

- ADHD in the Classroom
- High Achievers with ADHD

### What Every Parent of an ADHD Child Should Know About Their Legal Rights

You may be wondering what accommodations and services the school is required to provide. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal law that guarantees all children with disabilities the right to a free and appropriate public education. Under IDEA, students with ADHD are eligible for special education services and accommodations. These services and accommodations are designed to help students with ADHD succeed in school. Some common accommodations for ADHD include extra time on tests, preferential seating, and breaks throughout the day. With the right support(s) in place, your child can reach his or her full potential in school. Topics include:

- Accommodations for ADHD
- 504 Accommodations for ADHD
