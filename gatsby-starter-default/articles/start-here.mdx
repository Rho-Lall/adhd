## Breath

Many parents of children with ADHD find themselves feeling frustrated and exhausted when it comes to negotiating with the school. 
It can be an ordeal to try to get the accommodations that your child needs in order to be successful. Some parents give up and decide that it's not worth the fight. 
However, other parents prevail and are able to get the accommodations that their child needs. What makes the difference? Research, planning, and preparation. 
If you take the time to research what accommodations are available for students with ADHD, you will be better prepared to make a case for why your child needs them. 
You will also be more likely to have a successful outcome if you take the time to plan and prepare for your meeting with the school. 
Don't go into it blindly - know what you want and be ready to fight for it. With a little bit of effort, you can make sure that your child gets the accommodations he or she needs to be successful in school.

## The Three Hats You Wear

As the parent of a child with ADHD, you will find yourself wearing many different hats. Often, you will be called upon to be a subject matter expert, providing information and support to teachers, therapists, and other professionals who are working with your child. Additionally, you will play the role of advocate, ensuring that your child's needs. Finally, you may also find yourself taking on the role of project manager, coordinating services and creating systems to help your IEP team succeed. Each of these roles requires a different set of skills, but all are essential in supporting your child's success. With a little knowledge and a lot of dedication, you can wear all three hats with ease.

**Subject Matter Expert.** Learn about your child's ADHD and how ADHD affects your child's ability to learn. How does it affect your child specifically: their learning, appropriate educational remediation techniques, & measuring educational progress. Learn the laws that apply to your child's situation. There is statutory, regulatory, & case law that you will need to know. Learn from other parents, school personal, and other advocates.

**Advocate.** You are the natural advocate for your child. There are different types of advocates: lay advocates, educational advocates, school personnel, and parents. Lay advocates use their specialized knowledge and expertise to help parents resolve problems with schools. Educational advocates evaluate children with disabilities and make recommendations about services. When educational advocates go to eligibility and IEP meetings they are acting on the child's behalf. Don't underestimate yourself. Parents are natural advocates for their children.

As a case manager, I have had the opportunity to advocate on behalf of a variety of families navigating a network of bureaucracy to obtain appropriate services. In my experience, one of the biggest challenges families face is getting accommodations for students with ADHD. Too often, students with ADHD are placed in regular education classrooms without the support they need to be successful. As a result, they can quickly fall behind and become frustrated and discouraged. I have seen firsthand the difference that accommodations can make for students with ADHD. When they have the supports they need, they are able to thrive in school and reach their full potential. I believe all students with ADHD deserve access to accommodations that will allow them to succeed.

**Project Manager.** Managing an IEP can feel like a daunting task, but with a bit of planning and organization, it can be manageable - and even enjoyable! The key is to break the project down into smaller tasks, and then create a plan of action for each task. For example, if one of your goals is to get accommodations for students with ADHD, you might create a task list that includes research accommodations, reaching out to experts, and writing goals. By taking things one step at a time, you can make the process of managing an IEP much less overwhelming. And, by focusing on results, you can ensure that your efforts are effective and impactful. 

## Summary

There are certain steps that you need to take. Itâ€™s easy to get overwhelmed. Just take it a step at a time and breath. 
- Request to have your child tested for an IEP. 
- Your child gets tested.
- Meet with the school to discuss and review test results.
- Start your path to subject mater expertise.
- Manage outcomes of the IEP

In addition to taking these initial steps there are three key roles that you as a parent play as part of the IEP team:
- advocate
- subject matter expert
- project manager

The secret to success is preparation. Do your own research. Plan. Stay organized. You are well on your way.
