## Breath

By many accounts parents describe negotiating with the school as an ordeal, frustrating and exhausting. Some parents throw in the towel. Others prevail. What makes the difference?

Research. Planning. And preparation.

It is normal to feel overwhelmed. Just breath. Do not allow what's urgent to take priority over what's important. This is going to be a lot to take in. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Remember to pace yourself. As you come across new todo items just add them to your list. Remember to breath.

Success comes from knowing what's important and what isn't. Know what issues make parent-school conflict inevitable. Know what's worth fighting for. And what isn’t. The key is knowledge and skills. 


## The Three Hats You Wear

As a parent there are three main hats you will wear: subject mater expert, advocate, & project manager. Each role requires a different set of skills. 

**Subject Matter Expert.** Learn about your child's ADHD and how ADHD affects your child's ability to learn. How does it affect your child specifically: 
their learning, appropriate educational remediation techniques, & measuring educational progress. 
Learn the laws that apply to your child's situation. There is statutory, regulatory, & case law that you will need to know. 
Learn from other parents, school personal, and other advocates.

**Advocate.** You are the natural advocate for your child. 
There are different types of advocates: lay advocates, educational advocates, school personnel, and parents. 
Lay advocates use their specialized knowledge and expertise to help parents resolve problems with schools. 
Educational advocates evaluate children with disabilities and make recommendations about services. 
When educational advocates go to eligibility and IEP meetings they are acting on the child's behalf. 
Don't underestimate yourself. Parents are natural advocates for their children.

I have had the opportunity to advocate on behalf of a variety of families navigating a network of bureaucracy to obtain appropriate services.
My perspective on advocacy comes from working as a case manager for over four years. 
My hope is I can leverage that experience here.

**Project management.** Project-Managers plan, organize, monitor, and ensure the project gets to completion. What project? The IEP. 
Winnging with IEPs starts with writing effective goals. 
I come from a culture of rigorous project management; a results based focus on getting stuff done. 
I've worked and trained with truely fantastic project managers. My hope is to share what I’ve learned scaling results and creating routes to success.


## Summary

There are certain steps that you need to take. It’s easy to get overwhelmed. Just take it a step at a time and breath. 
- Request to have your child tested for an IEP. 
- Your child gets tested.
- Meet with the school to discuss and review test results.
- Start your path to subject mater expertise.
- Managing Your IEP Meeting

In addition to taking these initial steps there are three key roles that you as a parent play as part of the IEP team:
- advocate
- subject matter expert
- project manager

The secret to success is preparation. Do your own research. Plan. Stay organized. You are well on your way.
