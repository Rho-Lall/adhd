Accomodations for ADHD and other resources to develop accommodations for ADHD elementary students, thier parents, and teachers.

"

---
Negotiating with the school is frustrating and debilitating for many parents of students with ADHD. It can be an ordeal to try to get the accommodations that your child needs in order to be successful. Some parents give up resigned to make do with what they have. However, other parents prevail and are able to get the accommodations that their child needs. 

What makes the difference? Research, planning, and preparation. If you take the time to research possible accommodations for students with ADHD, you will be better prepared to make a case for why your child needs them. You can secure a successful outcome if you take the time to plan and prepare for your meeting with the school. 

Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes your child's right to participate in and contribute to society. Know exactly what you want and be ready to fight for it. With a little bit of effort, you can make sure that your child gets the accommodations or ADHD they need.

## The Three Hats You Wear

You wear a variety of hats as the parent of an ADHD elementary student. You,  as a subject-matter expert, provide information and support to instructors, therapists, and other professionals who work with your child. You play the role of advocate, ensuring your child's needs. Finally, you also find yourself taking on the role of project manager, coordinating services, and creating systems to help your IEP team succeed. Each of these roles requires a different set of skills, but all are essential in supporting your child's success. With a little knowledge and a lot of dedication, you can wear all three hats with ease.

**Subject Matter Expert.**  Learn about your child's ADHD and how it affects their learning. What effect does it have on your kid specifically: their learning, educational remediation methods, and measuring educational progress? You'll need to understand the rules that apply to your child's situation. Statutory, regulatory, and case law are all required reading. Learn from other parents, educators, and advocates.

**Advocate.** You are the natural advocate for your child. Lay advocates, educational advocates, school employees, and parents are among the many types of advocates. Lay advocates use their specialized knowledge and expertise to help parents resolve problems with schools. Lay Advocates assist parents in resolving issues with schools. A Lay Advocate is an advocate who specializes in particular aspects of education, such as family life, academic performance, and extracurricular activities. Educational advocates evaluate children with disabilities and make recommendations about services. At eligibility and IEP meetings, educational advocates are representing the interests of the kid. Parents are natural advocates for their children. Don't underestimate yourself. 

I believe all students with ADHD deserve access to accommodations that will allow them to succeed. As a case manager, I've had the chance to advocate on behalf of many families navigating a network of bureaucracy to obtain appropriate services. In my experience, one of the biggest challenges families face is getting accommodations for students with ADHD. Students with ADHD are frequently placed in regular education classrooms without the support they require to be successful. They fall behind and become frustrated and discouraged. I've seen first-hand how accommodations help students with ADHD. When they have the supports they need, they are able to thrive in school and reach their full potential. 

**Project Manager.** Managing an IEP can feel like a daunting task, but with a bit of planning and organization, it can be manageable - and even enjoyable! The key is to break the project down into smaller tasks, and then create a plan of action for each task. For example, if one of your goals is to get accommodations for students with ADHD, you might create a task list that includes researching accommodations, reaching out to experts, and writing goals. By taking things one step at a time, you can make the process of managing an IEP much less overwhelming. And, by focusing on results, you can ensure that your efforts are effective and impactful.

### STEP ONE: Request an IEP evaluation from your school. 

An IEP, also known as a Individualized Education Program, is a paper that specifies services such as accommodations and other supports to assist your child in school. Accommodations for ADHD might include, among other things, additional time for exams, preferred seating, and breaks during class. They are based on each child's unique needs and are meant to ensure your child’s access to a free appropriate public education. Students with ADHD can benefit greatly from accommodations in school.

### STEP THREE: Qualify for Services

It's time to get down to business. We'll go through IEPs, 504s, and the differences. I've set up distinct chapters for each of them. Individualized Education Plans are known as IEPs and are established when a student requires more assistance than the school may give in its general education setting. It is created by a team that includes medical personnel, educators, parents, and the student.

IEPs are established by the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and are designed to ensure a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities so they can have access to education comparable to their non-disabled peers. 

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. A 504 Plan is designed to accomodate children with disabilities so they can access general education with their non-disabled peers. 

When it comes to ADHD specifically, IEPs and 504 plans can both be used to ensure that students with ADHD receive necessary services. There are differences. We will get into them.
