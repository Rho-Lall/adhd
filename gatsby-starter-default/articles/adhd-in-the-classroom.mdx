## Findings & Research

Low expectations, and an insufficient focus on **applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching students with ADHD** impedes the development of ADHD elementary students. Almost 30 years of research and experience has demonstrated that ADHD teaching strategies can be made more effective by:
- having high expectations for elementary students with ADHD and ensuring their access to the general education curriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible
- strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home
- ensure that special education can become a service for students with ADHD rather than a place where ADHD children are sent
- high-quality, intensive preservice preparation and professional development for all personnel who work with children with disabilities in order to ensure that such personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement and functional performance of children with disabilities, including the use of scientifically based instructional practices, to the maximum extent possible
- incentives for whole-school approaches, scientifically based early reading programs, positive behavioral interventions and supports, and early intervening services to reduce the need to label children as disabled in order to address the learning and behavioral needs of students with ADHD
- focusing resources on teaching and learning while reducing paperwork and requirements that do not assist in improving educational results
- supporting the development and use of technology, including assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, to maximize teaching students with ADHD
