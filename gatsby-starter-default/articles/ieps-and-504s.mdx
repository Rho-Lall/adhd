Does an ADHD student qualify for special education? What are the criteria? Qualifying for services is as crucial as it is understated. We can't organize a plan until your child meets the necessary requirements for services.

> In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if [s/]he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity is a right that must be made available to all on equal terms. ~ The Supreme Court (in Brown VS Board of Education), 1954

When it comes to ADHD specifically, IEPs and 504s can both be used to ensure students receive necessary services. IEPs and 504s are spoken about hand in hand. There are differences. In many cases, Section 504 children are eligible for services under IDEA. In this article, you will learn about Section 504, in contrast to the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA). The shorthand between IEPs & 504s comes down to one word: accommodations.

If your child simply needs accommodations in order to access the general education curriculum then a 504 will be implemented. If however the general education curriculum is insufficient and your child requires specialized education then an IEP is appropriate.

Don't use the term "accommodations for ADHD" when specialized education is appropriate. You may inadvertently pigeonhole your child into a 504 plan when an IEP is warranted.

## What is an IEP?

Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) are established when a student requires more assistance than the school may give in its general education setting. It is created by a team that includes medical personnel, educators, parents, and the student. IEPs are established by the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and are designed to ensure a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities so they can have access to education comparable to their non-disabled peers.

## What is a 504 Plan?

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973(and the Americans with Disabilities Act) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. Section 504 states that a student cannot be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefit of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance on the basis of their ADD/ADHD. Under Section 504, your child may receive accommodations so they can access general education with their non-disabled peers.

## What's The Difference?

IDEA ensures your child receives an individualized education program (IEP) that is designed to meet his or her unique needs to **provide your child with educational benefit**, so your child is prepared [for employment and independent living](). 

Section 504 does none of this. Section 504 does not secure an IEP for your child. Section 504 protects you (the parent) and your child from discrimination on the basis of your child’s ADHD. Section 504 is part of a civil rights law that protects individuals with disabilities (students) from discrimination related to their disability and guarantees equal access to general education.

The difference is in “Access” vs. “Educational Benefit”. Both laws (Section 504 & IDEA) refer to your child’s right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE). However, the standard is different under each law. 

Under Section 504, [services … are designed to meet individual educational needs of a person with disabilities as adequately as the needs of a person without disabilities are met.]() Under Section 504, your child simply has the right to access the same free appropriate public education that is available to all children. There is no guarantee to [provide your child with educational benefit]().

IDEA’s standard recognizes that general education may not be sufficient for an ADHD elementary student due to complications from their ADHD. When this is the case IDEA outlines the development of an individualized education program (IEP) that must [provide your child with educational benefit]().

Some parents and educators believe that under IDEA, the child must be placed in a special education class, but if the child has a 504 plan, the child may remain in the regular classroom. Parents are then counseled that a 504 plan is more desirable. This is simply not true. Under IDEA, “special education” is a service, not a place or placement. 

> If your child simply needs accommodations in order to access the general education curriculum then a 504 will be implemented. If however the general education curriculum is insufficient and your child requires specialized education then an IEP is appropriate.

The truth is a child with a Section 504 plan has fewer rights, protections, and access to services than a child with an IEP.

## Qualifying for Accommodations for ADHD thru A Variety of Assessment Tools

Assessing eligibility for specialized education and accommodations for ADHD requires [a variety of assessment tools and strategies](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/2/A) to gather information about your child's academic ability as well as functional and developmental ability. The scope of information gathering strategies at the school's disposal includes information provided by you, the parent. The school cannot rely on [any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion]() for making a determination. The school must use a variety of technically sound instruments to assess the relative contribution of these factors: cognitive, behavioral, physical, and developmental.

## Is there Enough Data To Determine If Accommodations for ADHD are necessary?

The IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate review the data available including:

-  evaluations and information **provided by the parents** of the child;
-  current classroom-based, local, or state assessments, and classroom-based observations
-  observations by teachers and related services providers

On the basis of that review, **and input from the child’s parents**, the IEP team will identify what additional data, if any, is needed to determine —

-  whether your child is [a child with a disability]() as defined in section 1401(3)
-  the [educational needs of your child]()
-  the present levels of [academic achievement]() and [related developmental needs]() of your child
-  whether your child needs special education and related services to participate, as appropriate, in the general education curriculum

## ELIGIBILITY

If your child only requires accommodations for ADHD, and not special education (specially designed instruction), then s/he is not a student with a disability under IDEA and not eligible for an IEP. Such a student may be eligible for accommodations for ADHD under Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. 

To qualify for special education services, a student must meet three criteria: 

- The student has one of the identified disabilities outlined in the IDEA: ADHD is listed as a [specific learning disability]().
- The disability must adversely affect the student’s [educational performance](), including all of the school program: scognitive, behavioral, physical, and developmental.
- The student requires [special education and related services](). 

If the student doesn’t meet the criteria, then the student is not eligible for special education. Ask yourself:

- Does my child have a [diagnosis of ADHD]()?
- Does ADHD adversely affect my child's [educational performance]()? (cognitive, behavioral, physical, and developmental)
- Does my child require [specially designed instruction](/accomodations-for-students-with-adhd/iep-for-adhd/#supplementary-aids-modifications-and-accommodations) as a result of his or her ADHD?

To be eligible for an IEP the answer to each of these questions must be Yes.

## Specific Learning Disability

**Child with A Disability.** Among the specific list of conditions given in the definition for a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3) is "specific learning disabilities". The term “[specific learning disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/30)” means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which can manifest itself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations.

The short list of these "specific learning disabilities" includes "minimal brain dysfunction" which is now called Attention Deficit Disorder, ADD. Congress choose to not change the language of the original definition written in 1970. Many terms used to describe disabilities in IDEA are those used in the 1970's. 

In 2004 Congress did change the language about evaluations for specific learning disabilities: [the school is no longer required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/6)". Schools do not have to find a discrepancy between IQ and educational achievement to find a child with a specific learning disability eligible for special education services. This is consistent with the requirement for a determination based in the relative contribution of these factors: behavioral, physical, developmental, & not just congnitive.

Decisions about eligibility are made by a team that includes the parents. Parental input must be considered. If the child is determined not eligible, parents have the right to disagree and use any of the [dispute resolution remedies]() as outlined here.

## Discipline & Behavioral Issues

If your child misbehaves and the school determines your child’s behavior is not a manifestation of their ADHD, your child can be expelled from school permanently. Under IDEA, your child has the right to a free appropriate public education and the school has the responsibility to provide it, even if the child is expelled. Section 504 does not provide this protection.

This section on Behavioral Plans and discipline needs to be fleshed out.
