> In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms. ~ The Supreme Court (in Brown VS Board of Education), 1954

In many cases, Section 504 children are eligible for services under IDEA. In this section you will learn about Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (and the Americans with Disabilities Act), in contrast to the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA).

## What is an IEP?

An IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is a document that outlines the specific educational needs of a student with disabilities. If your child has an IEP, it means they receive specialized education services outlined in the document. This can include accommodations like extra time on tests, assistive technology, and modifications to the curriculum. If you're curious what's included in an IEP, keep reading!

## What is a 504 Plan?

An 504 plan is a plan put in place by a school. Under Section 504, your child may receive accommodations and modifications that are not available to children who do not have a disability. 

Section 504 states that a student cannot be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefit of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity recieving Federal financial assistance on the basis of thier ADD/ADHD.



## What's The Difference?

Compared to IDEA, Section 504 provides fewer protections and accomodations for ADHD (benefits). The key benefit is legal remedies if a school district retaliates against a parent or child for excercising thier rights. Section 504 is a civil rights law that protects individuals with disabilities (students) from discrimination related to thier disability. 

IDEA ensures your child receives an individualized education program (IEP) that is designed to meet the child’s unique needs and provide your child with educational benefits, so your child will be prepared “for employment and independent living.” 

Section 504 does none of this. Section 504 does not secure an IEP for your child. Section 504 protects you (the parent) and your child from discrimination on the basis of your child’s ADHD. 

The difference is in “Access” vs. “Educational Benefit”. Both laws (Section 504 & IDEA) refer to your child’s right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE). However, the standard is different under each law. Under Section 504, “services … are designed to meet individual educational needs of a person with disabilities as adequately as the needs of a person without disabilities are met.”  Under Section 504, your child simply has the right to access the same free appropriate public education that is available to all children. There is no guarantee to “provide your child with educational benefit”.

IDEA’s standard recognizes that such an education may not be sufficient for an ADHD elementary student due to complications from thier ADHD. When this is the case an IDEA outlines the development of an indivudualized education program (IEP) that must “provide your child with educational benefit.”

Some parents and educators believe that under IDEA, the child must be placed in a special education class, but if the child has a 504 plan, the child may remain in the regular classroom. This is simply not true. Under IDEA, “special education” is a service not a place or placement. Parents are then counciled that a 504 plan is more desirable based on this false information. The truth is a child with a Section 504 plan has fewer rights, protections, and accommodations for ADHD than a child with an IEP that secures accomodations for students with ADHD.

## Eligability

To qualify for special education services under IDEA your child must have a qualifying disability that is affecting thier ability to learn. Even if they don’t qualify for services under IDEA they may still qualify for protections under Section 504.

To be eligible for protections under Section 504 your child must have a mental imparement that substancially limits at least one major life activity. Examples of major life activities include: hearing, learning, reading, writing, performing math calculations, working, and preforming manual tasks.

## Discipline

If your child misbehaves and the school determines your child’s behavior is not a manifestation of their ADHD, your child can be expelled from school permanently. Under IDEA, your child has the right to a free appropriate public education and the school has the responsibility to provide it, even if the child is expelled. Section 504 does not provide this protection.

## Procedural Safeguards

Section 504 and IDEA require school districts to conduct impartial hearings for parents who disagree with identification, evaluation, & placement. Under Section 504, you have the opportunity to participate and be represented by counsel, other details are left to the discretion of the school district.

Procedural safeguards in IDEA include:
- your right to written notice before any change in placement
- your right to an independent educational evaluation at public expense
- your participation in all meetings about your child’s eligibility, special education program, and placement

Section 504 doesn’t require a meeting before a change in placement can be made. Section 504 doesn’t include many protections that are established by IDEA.
