This is a list of my questions. As I read and gain more knowlege this is a useful tool to remind me of how far I've come already. 
It's really easy to answer a question and roll into five more, at least for me.
It is also really easy to get distracted by everything you don't know, at least for me.
This is a way to keep me on point.

## Does my kid have ADHD?

## Can A Parent Have ADHD and Not Know?

## What is the difference between an IEP and a 504 Plan?

## Why should I listen to you?

Do you have a child with ADHD? Are looking for a resource to help you navigate public school bureaucracy? This is it.

When I started down this path I deferred a lot of the work to my spouse. I didn’t know the difference between a 504 plan and an IEP and I didn’t care to, really. As we started going down the path I soon realized this was going to take both of us.

I looked for resources to help me get up to speed and I came up short. I wanted something concise. I wanted to get boots on the ground and running while I learned what I needed to know when I needed to know it. That resource didn’t exist. 

"Maybe I can put one together?" I thought. In reality I didn’t think anyone would care to hear from the guy who is only a few steps ahead of them. I didn’t feel like I really had anything meaningful to contribute . . . that is until I started reading.

I am well over halfway through my second book on the subject of ADHD and advocacy. I’m wading through a lot of fluff. The first half of the book I’m reading delves into what I consider basic professional concepts. Maybe it has much broader audience that doesn't have the experience that I have? Maybe I'm just not valuing my experience as I should? I do have over four years of non-profit advocacy experience. I am trained as a professional project manager. Both of these roles the book argues are critical for a parent to know.

Maybe I do have something to offer. I think I do. Beyond that, my focus is narrowly defined to ADHD and how to advocate in a school setting for a student with ADHD. That focus allows for brevity and impact so we can get on with it.


## What are my rights? What are my kid's rights?

## Can the school kick him out? Or is he now considered a protected class? Can they still kick him out?

## What additional tools, resources, are available through an IEP?

## What should I advocate for? What is a waste of time?

## How do medicines work? What are the classes of medication? 

## What are the laws? Federal? State? City?

## What policies exist at the school level?

## How is the school organized? What are the levels in the beuraucrazy?

## Who has what power? To do what?

## What are the landmines to avoid?
