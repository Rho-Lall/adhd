This is a list of my questions. As I read and gain more knowlege this is a useful tool to remind me of how far I've come already. 
It's really easy to answer a question and roll into five more, at least for me.
It is also really easy to get distracted by everything you don't know, at least for me.
This is a way to keep me on point.
