If you think your child may have ADHD, the first step is to request an IEP evaluation from your schoo. An IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is a document that outlines accommodations and other supports that will be put in place to help your child succeed in school. Accommodations for adhd can include things like extra time for tests, preferential seating, and breaks during class. They are based on each child's unique needs and are meant to ensure your childâ€™s access to a free appropriate public education. Accommodations for students with adhd can make a big difference in their ability to learn and succeed in school. Don't hesitate to ask for an IEP evaluation if you think your child may benefit from one. 

## Requesting Testing for IEP

As a parent, you have [the right to request](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/B) the school evaluate your ADHD elementary student to determine:
- if your child is a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3)
- the educational needs that arise from your child's ADHD. 

The school must complete the evaluation [within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/C/i). When federal law creates a timeline in "days" this means calendar days, not school days. Some states may have statutes or regulations that permit longer timelines.

Parental consent is required for the school to test your child. The date you sign starts the 60 day clock for completing the evaluation. When requesting testing for IEP just ask at the front desk. There could be other documents you need to fill out as well. At the very least you will need to sign a release. Ask for copies of everything. If you get pushback, just ask for the documents that you need to fill out so you can get started on them. If they don't know what to do, they will know who to ask.

If you still get pushback, make the request in writting. Or just write the letter in advance and give it to them when you make your request. It is as simple as stating, 
>"I would like to have my child tested for an IEP. I made my request at the front desk on such-and-such date. I am following up that request with this letter."

Screening a student by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies is not the same as [an evaluation for eligibility for special education](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/E) and related services. It's a significant process that involves [a variety of assessment tools and strategies](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/2/A).
