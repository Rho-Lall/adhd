## A note to special educators. 

If emotions are under control on both sides, you will find it easier to work with parents, who learn the law. These parents want their children to learn. They want you to succeed. When parents document events and agreements, help their teams stay on task, and build strong working relationships with school personnel, everyone wins. Especially the children.

## A good education, is the most important gift you can give your child. 

As a parent of a child with the disability, you have two goals. One to ensure the school provides your child with **a free appropriate public education**, that includes special education and related services designed to meet your child's unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living. Second, to build a healthy working relationship with school personnel. 


### Step One. Request to have your child tested for an IEP. 

The school needs to get your written permission to test your child. At the very least you will need to sign a release. There could be other documents you need to fill out as well. Ask for copies of everything.

If you get pushback from the front desk, just ask them for the documents that you need to fill out so you can get started on them.

### Step Two. Your child gets tested. You want to have independent evaluations done as well.

### Step Three. Initial meeting with the school to discuss and review the tests.
- Understand what the different tests are.
- Understand the results of the tests.
- Determine significance of the results, what does this mean for your child?
- Gather feedback from medical team to identify the child’s needs.

There might be pushback from the school that the child doesn’t qualify for an IEP. 
- know the eligibility criteria for an IEP (statutory, regulatory, & case law)
- what are the local laws, and school board policies?
- what other pertinent information do you need to know about eligabiilty

### Step Four. What is an IEP?
- what to expect in the IEP meeting
- understand what your role is and what you bring to the table
    - then we can talk about testing, subject matter expertise, project management, etc 
- what the agenda should be, the purpose of the meeting(s)?
- How frequently are they going to be held?

### Step Five. Managing Your IEP Meeting
- preparing for your first IEP meeting
- project management
- RACI Matrix
- SMART IEP Goals and OKRs

# Getting Started

## Breath

By many accounts parents describe negotiating with this school as a frustrating exhausting ordeal. Some parents throw in the towel. Others prevail. What is the secret to success?
- Research
- Planning
- Preparation

In the beginning, it is normal to feel overwhelmed. Do not allow what's urgent to take priority over what's important. This is going to be a lot to take in. As you come across new todo items just add them to your list. Remember to breath.

Success comes from knowing what's important and what isn't. Know what issues make parent-school conflict inevitable. Know what's worth fighting for. And what isn’t. The key is knowledge and skills. 


## The three hats you wear

As a parent there are three main hats you will wear: subject mater expert, advocate, & project manager.

**Subject Matter Expert.** Learn about your child's ADHD and how ADHD affects your child's ability to learn. How does it affect your child specifically: their learning, appropriate educational remediation techniques, measuring educational progress, & writing effective goals for IEPs. Learn the laws that apply to your child situation. There is statutory, regulatory, & case law that you will need to know. 

**You are the natural advocate for your child.** There are different types of advocates: lay advocates, educational, advocates, school personnel, and parents. Lay advocates use their specialized knowledge and expertise to help parents resolve problems with schools. Educational advocates evaluate children with disabilities and make recommendations about services. When educational advocates go to eligibility and IEP meetings they are acting on the child's behalf. Parents parents are natural advocates for their children.

Who is your child's first teacher?

You are. 

Who is your child's most important role model?

You are. 

Who is responsible for your child's welfare?

You are.

Who has your child's best interests at heart?

You do.

I bring a perspective on advocacy that comes from working in social work, as a case manager for over four years. In that time I had the opportunity to aggressively advocate on behalf of my clients. My hope is I can leverage that experience here.

**Project management.** Project-Managers plan, organize, monitor, and ensure the project gets to completion. I come from a culture of rigorous project management; a results based focus on getting stuff done. My hope is to share what I’ve learned training and working with truely fantastic project managers.


## Summary

There are certain steps that you need to take. It’s easy to get overwhelmed. Just take it a step at a time and breath. 
- Request to have your child tested for an IEP. 
- Your child gets tested. You want to have independent evaluations done as well.
- Initial meeting with the school to discuss and review the tests.
- What is an IEP?
- Managing Your IEP Meeting

In addition to taking these initial steps there are three key roles that you as a parent play as part of the IEP team:
- advocate
- subject matter expert
- project manager

The secret to success is preparation. Do your own research. Plan. Stay organized. You are well on your way.
