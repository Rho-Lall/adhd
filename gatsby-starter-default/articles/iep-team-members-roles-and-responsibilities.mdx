IDEA is very specific about the required members of the IEP team, and [who should be in attendance for the entire meeting](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d/1/B). Here is a breakdown of [IEP team members](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d/1/B), and what their role is:

## IEP Team Member Roles & Responsibilities
- You, the Parent: You are your child's best advocate! As a parent, you know your child better than anyone else on the team. You will be able to provide valuable insights into your child's strengths, weaknesses, and needs.

- The Teacher: The teacher is the professional who works with your child the most. They will be able to provide detailed information about your child's progress in school, as well as any challenges they may be having. There must be not less than 1 regular education teacher on the IEP team.

- The Special Education Teacher: The special education teacher is a trained professional who can provide information about specialized instruction and accommodations for students with disabilities. There must be not less than 1 special education teacher on the IEP team.

- The School Administrator: The school administrator is the person who oversees the entire school.

- The Interpreter. Any of these previously mentioned faculty positions can serve as interpreter. An interpreter is simply a person who can speak to (interpret) the instructional implications of evaluation results. 

- The Gatekeeper: The gatekeeper may not be physically present during an IEP meeting but their influence is present. Gatekeepers limit access to special education services and often make decisions about eligibility.

- . . . and finally . . . your child! Where appropriate the ADHD elementary student should participate as part of the IEP team. [IDEA 1414.d.1.B.vii](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d/1/B)



> Parents have the ultimate say in young child involvement at an IEP meeting. Taking into consideration the studentâ€™s temperament and tolerance for the meeting is important. The student is also able to join a team for portions of a meeting if that is desired. 



## Special Education IEP Team Members Roles and Responsibilities
Special Education IEP team members roles and responsibilities include providing support to special needs students, developing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and collaborating with parents, teachers, and other professionals. They work to ensure that special needs students have access to the resources and services they need to succeed in school and in life sometimes providing direct instruction and support to students. In addition, special education team members monitor special needs students' progress and keep track of their IEP goals.



## General Education IEP Team Members Roles and Responsibilities
General education teachers play a pivotal role in making sure all students receive a free and appropriate public education. General education teachers must be actively involved in the development and implementation of IEPs. Special education teachers usually create IEPs, but general education teachers also have an important part to play by giving input and making sure that the goals of the IEP are both achievable and realistic. General education teachers are responsible for providing instruction and support to the student. 



By working together, general and special education teachers can help every student get the resources they need to succeed.



By collaborating with special education teachers, general education teachers can help ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.



## IEP Team Members Roles and Responsibilities for Administrators
Administrators provide valuable insight and perspective on how best to meet the student's individual needs. Administrators help ensure all members of the IEP team are on the same page and working together towards a common goal. In addition, administrators can offer support and guidance to parents and guardians who may be new to the IEP process. 



As such, administrator involvement in IEP meetings is essential to ensuring that your child receives the services and accommodations they need. They can provide information about district policies and procedures, as well as advocate for your child at the district level. The administrator supervises the provision of special education and is knowledgeable about the general education curriculum. The administrator is also knowledgeable about the availability of resources and is authorized to commit the necessary resources, including funding, to provide educational services for your child.
