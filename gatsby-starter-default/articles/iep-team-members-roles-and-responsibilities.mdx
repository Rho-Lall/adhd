## IEP Team Members

The IEP team is made up of a variety of professionals, all with different roles and responsibilities. Here is a breakdown of who should be on your child's IEP team, and what their role is:
- You, the Parent: You are your child's best advocate! As a parent, you know your child better than anyone else on the team. You will be able to provide valuable insights into your child's strengths, weaknesses, and needs.
- The Teacher: The teacher is the professional who works with your child the most. They will be able to provide detailed information about your child's progress in school, as well as any challenges they may be having.
- The School Psychologist: The school psychologist can provide valuable information about your child's cognitive and emotional functioning. They can also administer assessments to help the team identify your child's strengths and needs.
- The Special Education Teacher: The special education teacher is a trained professional who can provide information about specialized instruction and accommodations for students with disabilities.
- The School Administrator: The school administrator is the person who oversees the entire school. They can provide information about district policies and procedures, as well as advocate for your child at the district level.

**Special education team members** roles and responsibilities include providing support to special needs students, developing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and collaborating with parents, teachers, and other professionals. They work to ensure that special needs students have access to the resources and services they need to succeed in school and in life sometimes providing direct instruction and support to students. In addition, special education team members monitor special needs students' progress and keep track of their IEP goals.

When it comes to Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), **general education teachers** are essential. In order to ensure that all students have a free appropriate public education, general education teachers must be actively involved in the development and implementation of IEPs. While special education teachers are typically responsible for creating IEPs, general education teachers play a key role in providing input and ensuring that the goals of the IEP are realistic and achievable. In addition, general education teachers are responsible for providing instruction and support to students with IEPs in the general education classroom. By working collaboratively with special education teachers, general education teachers can help ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.

**Administrators** provides valuable insight and perspective on how best to meet the student's individual needs. Administrators help ensure all members of the IEP team are on the same page and working together towards a common goal. In addition, administrators can offer support and guidance to parents and guardians who may be new to the IEP process. As such, administrator involvement in IEP meetings is essential to ensuring that your child receives the services and accommodations they need.

## Why do projects fail?

The most common reasons projects fail are:
- lack of planning
- fuzzy goals
- team members who do not know what is expected of them
- team members, who do not get training and support
- team members who feel overburdened and underappreciated

It is clear that the IEP team itself is critical to success.
