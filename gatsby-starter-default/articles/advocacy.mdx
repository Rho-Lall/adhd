## What does advocacy involve? 

Advocates gather facts and information, they use facts and independent documentation to resolve, disagreements and disputes. 

They organized this information so that it's readily accessible. 

Advocates know, the rules of the game, they educate themselves about their local school district. They know their legal rights, they know a child with a disability is entitled to an appropriate education, not the best education. **Best is a four letter word**. Do not use it. 

Advocates plan and prepare to prevent problems. 

Advocates, use test scores to monitor progress. 

Advocates. Document. Everything. Documentation is the key to success, if it's not written down, it didn't happen. 

Make requests in writing and write polite, follow-up letters to document events discussions and meetings. 

Advocates are not afraid to ask questions. And they're not afraid to ask follow up questions. And then, even more questions. Use questions to identify the process as well as the reasons behind certain positions and policies. 

Advocates. Learn to define and describe problems from all angles. 

Advocates are problem solvers. Advocates aren't looking to assign blame.
