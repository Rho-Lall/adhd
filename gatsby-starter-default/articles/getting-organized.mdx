## A BulletProof Document Management System

the master plan is a one page document that goes in the file when you're done with it, it should go in the front of the file. 

That's useful. So the first thing they offered was if you're going to put together a file, you want to store the data like paperwork. If you have document, document storage documents storage, 101 store, your documents and chronological order, and then index them. So, whatever categories you are going to put them in right to. 

Because that's the natural thing that you want to do is you want to put emails with emails and assessments with assessments and and that kind of a thing instead of physically putting them and categories, create an index and assign tags. So each document is a record. It's dated, it's titled and you can add whatever tags you want. 

And so, when you do that, your first few pages of your file is an index of the documents and you can get a very high level perspective and go through the entire dock, the entire file in a very short period of time because all of that information is summarized in a few pages and then you can scan two or three pages very quickly to get to what you need to find and it's not beholden to remembering. 

Did I file, you know, I received an assessment from the doctor in an email. Is that filed under assessment? Is that filed under email? Is it filed under something else? Right? The doctors name or something like that. 

So that seemed to come from a place of knowledge and experience and was useful.



We need to get copies of emails. We need to get his test results because the school is going to say his disability is not affecting his education, he doesn't qualify for an IEP and we are going to provide the emails and everything that we have written down that is going to say it's absolutely affecting his education. 

He needs an IEP Sydney, thought that having him sit next to the teacher was not a good solution because it kept him. It's it isolated him from other students. It put the minute. I said that her response was, you know, that affects his best ability to socialize with other students. 

And she asked me, how's he doing socially? And I said, you know, he's really friendly and he is able to make friends quickly. He's able to initiate, but he is starting to see ill effects on his disability. And and that is absolutely affecting him And so she's saying you want to get all of that written down. 

And then essentially say if there isn't a problem then what the hell are you emailing us about, right?
