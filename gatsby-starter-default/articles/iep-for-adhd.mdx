Do you have a child who has been diagnosed with ADHD? If so, then you know that it can be a challenge to help them succeed in school. An IEP can be a great tool to help your child get the accommodations they need to be successful. This guide will give you tips on how to work with your child's teacher and create an effective IEP. We will discuss:
- What is an IEP for ADHD and what does it include
- How can I help my child succeed in school with an IEP for ADHD
- What are the benefits of having an IEP for ADHD

## What is an IEP for ADHD and What Does It Include

An IEP, or Individualized Education Plan, is a written statment for students with ADHD that is legally binding. The IEP must include [a statment of your child’s present levels of academic achievement and functional performance](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d) including how the child’s disability affects your child’s involvement and progress in the general education curriculum. The IEP team must determine your child's educational needs as well as present level of academic achievement and related developmental needs.

The IEP must also contain [a statement of measurable annual goals](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d), including academic and functional goals, designed to meet your child’s needs resulting from ADHD to enable your child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum and meet your child's other educational needs. 

There must be a description of how your child's progress will be measured. 

There must be statment of the IEP accommodations for ADHD, [special education and related services and supplementary aids and services, based on peer-reviewed research](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d) that the student will need in order to be successful in school. As well as a projected date for the begining of services.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution of what an IEP for ADHD should look like because every child with ADHD is different. That said, there are some common accommodations that can be made for students with ADHD that can help promote success in school. Some common accommodations for students with ADHD include more time for tests and assignments, preferential seating, and breaks throughout the day.

In addition, many students with ADHD benefit from having a daily schedule or list of tasks that they can refer to throughout the day as well as regular check-ins with a teacher or guidance counselor. The goal of an IEP is to provide a free appropriate public education to all students including those with disabilities that affect their ability to learn. By working with the child's teachers and school administrators, you can develop an IEP that meets the unique needs of your child to provide them with the support they need to succeed in school.



## How can I help my child succeed in school with an IEP for ADHD

As a parent, you play an important role in advocating for IEP accommodations for adhd. If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, you may be wondering how you can help them succeed in school. One of the most impactful steps you can take is to develop an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) with the school. The IEP team members develop the IEP. In developing the IEP the IEP team members must consider:

- your child's strengths
- your concerns as the parent
- the results of the initial evaluation
- academic needs of your child
- developmental needs of your child
- functional needs of your child

**Consideration of Special Factors**. In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning or that of others, consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior [IDEA 1414.d.3.B.i](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d/3). Your child's regular education teacher, as a member of the IEP Team, should participate in the development of the IEP, including the determination of appropriate positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, and the determination of supplementary aids and services, program modifications, and support for school personnel [IDEA 1414.d.3.C](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/d/3).

**Placement**. The IDEA has a special provision for “parent participation in placement decisions.” Local school boards must ensure that you, the parents, are members of any group that makes decisions regarding the placement and LRE of your child. Decisions about your child's placement cannot be made until after the IEP team, including you the parents, meet and reach concensus about the IEP goals. The law is clear on this issue, school personel however, persist in deciding on the child's program and placement before the IEP meeting. Such unilateral action prevents parents from "meaningful participation" in the educational decision-making process. When Congress added this provision, 1414.e, to the IDEA in 1997, they sent a message that a unilateral educational placement decision by school officials is illegal. The school must ensure that the you, the parent, are part of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of your child [IDEA 1414.e](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/e).

Almost 30 years of research and experiance has demonstrated that the education of children with ADHD is made more effective by strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have "meaningful opportunities" to participate in the education of thier children at school and at home [IDEA 1400.c.5](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1400/c/5)

Parents have the right to equal participation in this process, and are entitled to notification of a planned evaluation, access to planning and evaluation materials, and involvement in all meetings regarding their child’s placement. Additionally, parents retain the right to refuse further evaluation of their child. Both students and parents must be invited to IEP meetings, and the IDEA explicitly establishes a role for the parent as equal participant and decision maker.

## What are the benefits of having an IEP for ADHD

An IEP can provide your child with much-needed support and accommodations that can help them succeed in school. Some common accommodations that may be included in an IEP for a child with ADHD include:
- Extended time on tests and assignments
- Preference seating in the classroom
- Frequent breaks
- Use of a fidget toy or other visual aids
-A quiet place to work away from distractions
-Alternatives to traditional homework assignments

Your child's IEP should be tailored to their specific needs, so be sure to talk to their teachers and service providers to get input on what would be most helpful.  An important first step in the process is to conduct an evaluation to identify your child's specific needs. Once you have an IEP in place, you and your child's teachers can work together to make sure they are receiving the accommodations and support they need to succeed.
