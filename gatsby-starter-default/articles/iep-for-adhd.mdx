As a project manager for your child's IEP team, it is essential for goals and objectives to be clear and concise. Your role is to bring clarity to the chaos and help everyone on the team stay focused on the task at hand. Every member of the IEP team has a role to play, including yourself, and it is important that you understand what those roles are in order to secure modifications and accommodations for ADHD as needed.

Following are three resources that will help your IEP team achieve success. In this article, we'll go through what goes into an IEP. We'll discuss how you may assist the IEP team succeed. In the section after that, IEP Team Members, Roles, and Responsibilities, we'll go through each member of the IEP team, including you. The article, Accommodations for ADHD provides some suggestions to help you come up with ideas to suggest at your next IEP meeting.

## Working with the IEP Team
Your youngster's IEP team is critical to his or her development. The IEP team will be more successful and efficient if goals are established at the start. When you make things clear, confusion turns to clarity, and everyone on the team can focus on the tasks at hand. You can require someone to do their job but you can’t ask them to sacrifice. That has to come from them. Teachers are accustomed to sacrifice. It sets them apart from other professionals. Your role is to show them why their sacrifice matters. In the following article, we'll learn more about your team members.

## Why do projects fail?
Project management involves more than just setting goals. It also includes developing a plan of action, assigning tasks, monitoring progress, and ensuring that everyone involved is kept in the loop. This can be particularly challenging when working with a team of people who have different responsibilities and priorities. It's important to stay organized and keep everyone on track so that the project can be completed successfully.

>Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. ~ John Wooden, UCLA basketball.



The most common reasons projects fail are:

- lack of planning
- fuzzy goals
- team members who do not know what is expected of them
- team members, who do not get training and support
- team members who feel overburdened and underappreciated

Project management is a profession, I can't do it justice here. If you want to enhance your project management skills, looking into SCRUM could be incredibly beneficial for you. Take a look at the book, Scrum: The Art of doing Twice the Work in Half the Time.

## The IEP
The IEP is your child’s written Individualized Educational Program that is developed, reviewed and revised in a meeting. The IEP also:

- Provides the basis for your child’s educational placement
- Must be written within 30 calendar days after your child is declared eligible for services
- Must be in effect at the beginning of each school year
- Teachers are accountable for delivering the services indicated on the IEP
- Must be written in a team meeting that includes the parents

Teachers and other school personnel are not held accountable if a student with a disability does not achieve the goals and objectives set forth in the IEP, but they are held accountable for providing the services outlined in the IEP.

### Purpose of the IEP
Parents and school personnel can use the IEP to communicate with each other about the student's needs, jointly decide what goals the student will work to meet, and agree upon which services will be provided in order for the student to reach said goals.



The purpose of an IEP meeting is to provide parents and school personnel with the opportunity to resolve disagreements about a student's special education needs. If necessary, procedural protections are available to both parents and schools.



Provides a written commitment of resources necessary to enable your child to receive needed special education and related services.



Provides a compliance and monitoring document that can be used by authorized persons from each level of government to determine whether a student with a disability is receiving the free, appropriate public education (FAPE) agreed to by the parents and the school.



The law requires that a team meeting be held once a year, resulting in the creation of an IEP document. Based on the child's needs determined by the evaluation, parents and school personnel make joint decisions about the youngster's educational program. The IEP is a written record of the conclusions reached at the meeting.

### Notice of Meeting
Parents will receive a notice before the meeting that states its purpose(s), time, location and attendees. They have the right to bring others with knowledge or special expertise.

### IEP Components
IEPs must contain a variety of components which are required by IDEA. In addition, there are a number of items that must be considered, and if they are needed, they must also be included in the IEP. The list below gives a summary of what is contained in each section of the IEP:



- Present Level of Academic Achievement & Functional Performance (PLAAFP) to identify needs

- Annual Measurable Goals related to what your child is expected to learn this year

- Special Education & Related Services designed to meet your student's educational needs

- Supplementary Aids, Modifications, and Accommodations



Parents have information that is crucial to the development of the IEP. Not only do they bring special expertise surrounding their child’s disability, but parents can also help generate ideas that they believe will be helpful for their child.

## Present Level of Academic Achievement & Functional Performance (PLAAFP)
This section of the IEP describes how your child is doing in school based on current information. “Current” information usually means information no more than a year old. The present levels of academic achievement and functional performance statement (commonly called “present levels”) should cover all areas of development where your child may need support. Some examples are:



- How the student’s disability affects the student’s involvement and progress in the general education curriculum

- The statement should clearly describe performance in academic areas (reading, math, communication, etc.) as well as nonacademic areas (social/emotional needs, activities of daily living, mobility, etc.)



> If your child is new to special education, this information will come from the tests and observations done during your child’s evaluation for eligibility. If your child’s IEP is being revised, the information may come from evaluations done during the year (by the school or from an Independent Educational Evaluation or IEE.



A clearly composed and thorough PLAAFP is critical since it serves as the basis for all of the IEP content. Your child's current capabilities serve as the foundation for goals. Special education and related services are provided based on your child's existing capabilities and objectives that emerge from those abilities. Be thorough. The information you include will be the stepping stone to writing the rest of the IEP. 



## Annual Measurable Goals
The IEP team works to establish suitable objectives to meet the needs of your child that have been identified. An annual goal describes what your youngster can be expected to accomplish or learn in a year. The IEP's annual goals (and, if necessary, short-term objectives) section builds on your child's Present Level of Academic Achievement and Functional Performance. The current levels statement describes your child's needs, while the goals (and, in some cases, objectives) are written to meet those needs.



A statement of measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals are designed to: 



- Enable students with disabilities to participate in and make progress in the general education curriculum by meeting their needs.

- Meet the additional educational needs that stem from the student's disability.

- Align with the student’s enrolled grade –level academic content standards or alternate academic achievement standards. 

- If alternate assessments are used for your student, then the goal must include benchmarks or short term objectives, which are smaller steps to help the student reach the goal.



Effective goals are critical parts of your child’s IEP. Keeping track of your child’s progress is just as important. How will you and the school know if your child is making enough progress to reach a goal by the end of the year? 



The IEP team must decide:



- How your child’s progress will be measured; and

- When periodic reports on your child’s progress will be provided to you. 



When special and general education teachers team up to create IEP goals that match state standards, it benefits everyone by breaking down barriers to learning and providing access to rigorous learning content. 



Students with special needs are capable of rigorous work. They can live up to high expectations and demonstrate learning at high levels, as long as the instruction is accompanied by appropriate support strategies. 



## Special Education & Related Services
IDEA provides a variety of services and supports that your child may need as part of his or her free appropriate public education. These services and supports are designed to help your student attain their annual goals, be involved in the general curriculum, participate in extracurricular and other non-academic activities, and be educated with other students with disabilities and non-disabled students. These services and supports include:



**Special Education Services:** Special education is not a physical place, but rather a unique set of services that can be delivered in various locations to support your child's individual educational needs. Such services can consist of:



- A curriculum that is tailored to a student's specific needs, in contrast to those of same-age peers who do not have disabilities.

- The same (general education) curriculum that all other students receive, with modifications or adaptations made for your kid

- A combination of these examples



**Related Services:** It is the IEP team’s responsibility to review all of the evaluation information and identify any related services your child needs to include in the IEP. Your school district is responsible for making sure all services listed in your child’s IEP are provided, even if the district does not directly provide these services. The term related services includes, but is not limited to:



- Speech-language pathology and audiology

- Transportation

- Interpreting services

- Psychological services

- Physical and occupational therapy

- Early identification and assessment of disabilities in students

- Health services and school nurse services 



The location and duration of the service(s) for your child are to be written down in the IEP and should include:

- How often your child will receive the service(s) (number of times per day, week, month etc.);

- How long each session will last (number of minutes);

- Where services will be provided (in the general education classroom or another setting such as a resource room); and

- When services will begin and end (starting and ending dates). 



Your school district is responsible for making sure all services listed in your child’s IEP are provided, even if the district does not directly provide these services.

## Supplementary Aids, Modifications, and Accommodations
The team must collaborate to ensure that your child receives the extra resources and services he or she needs to be successful. Your team should discuss your child's requirements, the curriculum, and school routine openly in order to ensure that all necessary supports are provided for him or her.



**Supplementary Aids and Services:** Aids, services and other supports provided in regular education classes or other education-related settings to enable students with disabilities to be educated with children who do not have disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate. Some examples of these additional services and supports are:



- Adapted equipment—such as a pencil grip, special seat, etc.

- Assistive technology—such as a computer, special software, or a communication system

- training for staff, the student, and/or parents 



**Modifications:** Modifications fundamentally or substantially alter or lower the standards or requirements. They change what the child is learning. Modifications could include adapted programming, content or instruction. Some examples may include:



- Reduction and simplification of materials, assignments, homework, school projects or tests.

- Grade Modification toward a Pass/Fail option if grade falls below a “C” grade

- grading against completed work only

- Assign no homework or reduced homework requirement for a subject.

- Change the class behavior expectations for the student (based on the disability and Behavioral Intervention Plan.) 



**Accommodations:** are the changes in the how—the way things are usually done in school/class/assessment, in order to provide the student an equal opportunity to participate. The changes do not fundamentally or substantially alter or lower the standards of the core curriculum. The student is learning the same material (general curriculum) as other same aged students. Below are some examples:



- Break assignments into segments of shorter tasks

- Give frequent reminders

- Increase amount of time to complete assignments or tests

- Give tests orally



The Core Curriculum represents those standards of learning that are essential for all students. They are ideas, concepts and skills that provide a foundation on which subsequent learning may be built. The Utah State Board of Education sets the standards which must be completed by all students K-12 as a requisite to graduate from Utah’s secondary schools.

## Assessments & Accomodations
Students who require special education should be given appropriate support on assessments. The IEP should contain these accommodations. To make effective use of these aids, the student must employ them in the classroom on a daily basis in order to take advantage of such aids on state and district assessments. 



The team must reevaluate this at least once a year, taking into account any assessments that the student will take at the district, state, or national level, as well as any necessary accommodations. Many features have been integrated into new and computerized tests thanks to new technologies. The IEP team will be able to analyze these and see whether any further supports are needed.



For more information on the assessment of students with disabilities, see the Utah Performance Assessment System for Students, Assessment Participation and Accommodations Policy. This is a guide that is provided by the Utah State Board of Education to help school personnel make decisions about using accommodations on various assessments, and it outlines the state policies regarding the assessment of students with disabilities.
