If you're the parent of a child with ADHD, you know that accommodations can make all the difference in their success at school. But between work, home life, and everything else on your plate, it can be tough to stay organized and on top of everything. Having documentation at your fingertips is vital. Start early. You want to get organized and stay organized. Here are a wining strategy to help you out.

## BulletProof Document Management 

Get a three-ring binder for all of your child's school-related documents, and make sure to save everything related to their ADHD and education in it. This includes things like doctor's notes, assessment results, and email communications.

Naturally, you are going to want to group documents together. Emails with emails. Assessments with assessments. Resist! Don't do it! Imagine you receive an assessment from the doctor in an email. Do you file it under assessments? Or email? Or is it under the Doctor's name?

Instead, organize all documents in chronological order. Date everything with a soft lead pencil. You may need to erase later. Don't write on original documents. Make copies. You can make your notes on a copy or on a sticky note attached to the document.

Once dated, index your documents. Put all the documents in order. When you hole punch make sure to not destroy important dates or signatures. Resist the temptation to read them, that comes later. Once in order, start with the first record. On a separate sheet of paper, write down the date, name of the document and what it is: email, assessment, letter, etc. If you want to create categories you can do that in the index. Just create a list of tags that you can use to categorize each record. Turn the page to your next record and add the second row to your index. Include a record for every document in your file. Now, when you need to find something, consult your index. 

**Four Rules for Organizing Your File**
- Do not write on original documents
- Do not use marker or highlighter on your original documents
- Do not release your original documents to anyone
- Keep your binder current

## Request Your Child's Records

Make a note of any persons or agencies who may have knowledge or records about your child. Send each a letter asking for copies of your child's records. Explain that you are making the request in connection with a school concern and the need to provide an appropriate education for your child. Request a complete copy of your child's entire cumulative file and confidential file from the school, omitting nothing. Expect to be charged a fee. Write two letters: one to the principal and another to the special education director.

## See the BIG Picture

When you read the information chronologically you see the big picture. Usually, reports are written and filed away never to be read again. Few people review this information. Because no one sees the big picture plans are short-sighted.

If you want to get a sense of what is in your file, scan the index. You can see at a glance what topics are covered and how many documents there are on each topic. This will give you a good overview of the contents of your file.

Organizing your files doesn't have to be a daunting task. By taking some time to create an index, you can make it much easier to find what you need, when you need it. And, by keeping your file well-organized, you'll be able to work more efficiently and effectively. So, take some time to create an index for your files today. You'll be glad you did!

## What Do I Include In the File

Everything! How can anyone make sound judgments about your child if they don't have adequate, precise information on him? Print out every email. Schools keep records in a variety of locations. Records and reports can be misplaced. The "actual test scores" will be used to compare the "expected test results" to assess how well your organization is executing on the new standards. You don't want a spreadsheet with the findings; you want the actual graded assessment. You may obtain a full copy of your child's entire educational record, including medical records, special education papers, formal and informal correspondence, discipline records, tests, evaluations, and teacher-to-teacher notes. There might be a charge and a policy concerning copies.

## Sic Vis Pacem Para Bellum

Assume that without a hearing to resolve your child's IEP-related difficulties, you will not be able to secure accommodations for ADHD. Assume that the school refuses to provide your child with services. What do you do? 

Due process hearings are used to decide special education disputes. A due process hearing is civil litigation. You need evidence and proof in order to win, just like you would in any court proceeding. Your file is your evidence and proof of what has happened. Evidence can include:

- letters written after meetings
- notes and transcripts of meetings
- test scores
- your journal
- your contact log of telephone calls
- reports, evaluations, & observations of your child (by independent experts)
- research reports
- newspaper articles
- school guidelines
- handbooks
- publications
- audits of your school system

To Avoid Conflict, Prepare for Conflict. If you enter a meeting prepared for a due process hearing then you have done your part as an advocate for your child. If you document the meeting and follow up with polite letters you have done your part as an advocate for your child. Anything less than that and you are relying on the school faculty to carry you. They might not. Sic vis pacem, para bellum is a latin adage that translates as "If you want peace, prepare for war." The time to prepare is not when conflict is imminent but rather when times are peaceful. 

You prepare by maintaining the file as complete as possible with documentation.

## Your Master Plan

In the next section, I am going to take you through the creation of your master plan. Project Management in its highest form is leadership. This is a leader's tool. The master plan is your tool to lead the IEP team to successful outcomes. It is a one-page document that includes vital information to help you successfully guide the team to positive outcomes for your child. The master plan should be filed in the front of your binder, right after the index.
