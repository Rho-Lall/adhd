The second critical thing you need to do after you request your child be tested for ADHD is to get organized. Half the battle is already won through organization and preparation. This isn't a prerequisite to the work at hand . . . this is the work at hand. 



[Accommodations for ADHD]() can make all the difference in your child's success at school. But between work, home life, and everything else on your plate, it can be tough to stay organized and on top of everything. Having documentation at your fingertips is vital. Start early. You want to get organized and stay organized. 



IEPs are by nature short-term. An advantage of organizing your information is to get the whole picture of everything, you'll be able to see where to focus and what to fight for. In [Developing Page One]() I'll take you through a tool that will help you do just that. Preparedness and organization give your child and IEP team the greatest chance of success.



## BulletProof Document Management 



Get a three-ring binder for all of your child's school-related papers, and make sure to keep everything related to their ADHD and education in it. This covers notes from the doctor, assessment findings, and email conversations among other things.



Keep everything chronological by dating it with a pencil (you may need to erase later). Make copies instead of writing on originals, then take notes on a sticky note linked to the document. Organize all of the papers in chronological sequence. When you hole punch, be careful not to damage significant dates or signatures.



After they've been dated, file your papers. Don't fall into the trap of reading them! Begin with the first document and work your way through each record in sequence. Make a note on a separate sheet of paper of the date, document name, and what it is: email, evaluation, letter, etc.



You may want to group your documents together by putting all emails in one place and all assessments in another. However, resist the urge! Imagine receiving an assessment from the doctor through email. Would you file it under 'assessments,' 'email,' or under the Doctor's name?



You can also make categories in the index. Simply start a list of the tags you want to use to categorize each record. Turn to the next page in your records and add the second row to your index. Include a record for every document in your file. Now, when you need to find something, consult your index. 



**Four Rules for Organizing Your File**

- Do not write on original documents

- Do not use marker or highlighter on your original documents

- Do not release your original documents to anyone

- Keep your binder current



## Request Your Child's Records



Keep track of everyone who may have knowledge or documents regarding your child, and send each a letter asking for copies of what they have. Make sure to explain that you're making the request in response to a school concern and that you need all the information to provide an appropriate education for your kid.



Obtain your child's entire academic and confidential records from their school by contacting the principal and special education director. You may be charged a fee for this request.



## See the BIG Picture



When you read the records chronologically you will see the big picture. Usually, reports are written and filed away never to be read again. Few people take the time to review this information. Because no one sees the big picture plans are short-sighted.



It doesn't have to be a daunting experience to organize your paperwork. You may make it much simpler to discover what you need when you need it by creating an index. The index will give you a quick overview of the topics covered in your file as well as how many documents pertain to each topic. You will be able to work more efficiently and effectively if your file is well-organized. So, take some time now to create an index for your papers. You'll be happy you did!



## What Do I Include In the File



All of it! If a school doesn't have accurate, precise information about your child, how can they make sound judgments? 



You may obtain a full copy of your child's entire educational record, including medical records, special education papers, formal and informal correspondence, discipline records, tests, evaluations, and teacher-to-teacher notes. You don't want a spreadsheet with test scores; ask for the actual graded assessment. There might be a charge and a policy concerning copies.



Schools keep records in different places. Records and reports have been known to get misplaced. Print out every email. Print it all out.



## Sic Vis Pacem Para Bellum



Assume that without a hearing to resolve your child's IEP-related difficulties, you will not be able to secure accommodations for ADHD. Assume that the school refuses to provide your child with services. What do you do? 



Due process hearings are formal means to resolve special education disputes. A due process hearing is civil litigation. You need evidence and proof in order to win, just like you would in any court proceeding. Your file is your evidence and proof of what has happened. Evidence can include:



- letters written after meetings

- notes and transcripts of meetings

- test scores

- your journal

- your contact log of telephone calls

- reports, evaluations, & observations of your child (by independent experts)

- research reports

- newspaper articles

- school guidelines

- handbooks

- publications

- audits of your school system



To Avoid Conflict, Prepare for Conflict. Sic vis pacem, para bellum is a latin adage that translates as "If you want peace, prepare for war." The time to prepare is not when conflict is imminent but rather when times are peaceful. 



If you enter a meeting prepared for a due process hearing then you have done your part as an advocate for your child. If you document the meeting and follow up with polite letters you have done your part as an advocate for your child. Anything less than that and you are relying on the school faculty to carry you. They might not. 



## What Do I Need?



You prepare by maintaining the file as complete as possible with documentation. You will need:



- (2) three ring notebooks. One is to organize your child's documents. A second to organize your research to support your subject matter expertise.

- three-hole punch

- highlighters

- sticky notes

- envelopes

- stamps

- calendar

- journal

- contact log

- audio recorder



## Your Master Plan



In the next section, I am going to take you through the creation of your [one page OGSP](). One of the three hats you wear is Project Manager: in its highest form, project management is leadership. This is a leader's tool. An OGSP is your tool to lead the IEP team to success. It is a one-page document that includes vital information to help you successfully guide the team to positive outcomes for your child. The OGSP should be filed in the front of your binder, right after the index.
