If the children are untaught, their ignorance and vices will in future life cost us much dearer in their consequences than it would have done in their correction by a good education. ~ Thomas Jefferson

If you're the parent of a child with ADHD, you know that accommodations can make all the difference in their success at school. But between work, home life, and everything else on your plate, it can be tough to stay organized and on top of everything. Having documentation at your fingertips is vital. Start early. You want to get organized and stay organized. Here are a few tips to help you out.

## BulletProof Document Management 

Create a folder for all of your child's school-related documents, and make sure to save everything related to their ADHD and education in it. This includes things like doctor's notes, assessment results, and email communications.

Naturally, you are going to want to group documents together. Emails with emails. Assessments with assessments. Resist doing so. Imagine you received an assessment from the doctor in an email. Is that filed with the assessments? Or email? Or is it under the Doctor's name?

Instead, organize all documents in chronological order. And then index them. First put all the documents in order. Resist the temptation to read them, that comes later. Once they are in order, start with the first record. On a separate sheet of paper, write down the data, name of the document and what it is: email, assessment, letter, etc. If you want to create categories you can do that in the index. Just create a list of tags that you can use to categorize each record. Turn the page to your next record and add the second row to your index. Include a record for every document in your file. Now, when you need to find something, consult your index. 

  If you want to get a sense of what is in your file, scan the index. You can see at a glance what topics are covered and how many documents there are on each topic. This will give you a good overview of the contents of your file.

Organizing your files doesn't have to be a daunting task. By taking some time to create an index, you can make it much easier to find what you need, when you need it. And, by keeping your file well-organized, you'll be able to work more efficiently and effectively. So, take some time to create an index for your files today. You'll be glad you did!

## What Do I Include In the File

Everything! Print out every email. Request test results with the "actual test scores". You don't want a spreadsheet with the results, you want the acutal graded assessment. You can request a complete copy of your child's cummulative and confidential educational records including: medical records, special education records, formal and informal correspondence, disapline records, tests, evaluations, and teacher-to-teacher notes. There may be a cost and policy about photocopies.

## Your Master Plan

In the next section, I am going to take you through the creation of your master plan. Project Management in its highest form is leadership. This is a leader's tool. The master plan is your tool to lead the IEP team to successful outcomes. It is a one-page document that includes vital information to help you successfully guide the team to positive outcomes for your child. The master plan should be filed in the front of your binder, right after the index.
