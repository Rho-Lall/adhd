If you're the parent of a child with ADHD, you know that accommodations can make all the difference in their success at school. But between work, home life, and everything else on your plate, it can be tough to stay organized and on top of everything. Having documentation at your fingertips is vital. Start early. You want to get organized and stay organized. Here are a few tips to help you out.

## BulletProof Document Management 

Get a three-ring binder for all of your child's school-related documents, and make sure to save everything related to their ADHD and education in it. This includes things like doctor's notes, assessment results, and email communications.

Naturally, you are going to want to group documents together. Emails with emails. Assessments with assessments. Resist doing so. Imagine you received an assessment from the doctor in an email. Is that filed with the assessments? Or email? Or is it under the Doctor's name?

Instead, organize all documents in chronological order. Date everything with a soft lead pencil. You may need to erase your notations later. Don't write on original documents. You may need to make copies. You can make your notes on a separate copy or on a sticky note attached to the document.

Once your documents are dated, index them. Put all the documents in order. When you hole punch make sure to not destroy important dates or signatures. Resist the temptation to read them, that comes later. Once in order, start with the first record. On a separate sheet of paper, write down the date, name of the document and what it is: email, assessment, letter, etc. If you want to create categories you can do that in the index. Just create a list of tags that you can use to categorize each record. Turn the page to your next record and add the second row to your index. Include a record for every document in your file. Now, when you need to find something, consult your index. 

**Four Rules for Organizing Your File**
- Do not write on original documents
- Do not use marker or highlighter on your original documents
- Do not release your original documents to anyone
- Keep your binder current

## Request Your Child's Records

Make a list of all individuals or agencies that may have information or records about your child. Send a letter to each requesting a copy of your child's records. Explain that your request relates to a school issue and the need to secure an appropriate education for your child. Write a letter to the school to request a complete copy of your child's entire cumulative file and confidential file, omitting nothing. Expect to pay a fee. Send one letter to the principal and another to the director of special education.

## See the BIG Picture

When you read the information chronolically you see the big picture. Usually reports are written and filed away never to be read again. Few people review this information. Because there is no master plan no one sees the big picture. 

If you want to get a sense of what is in your file, scan the index. You can see at a glance what topics are covered and how many documents there are on each topic. This will give you a good overview of the contents of your file.

Organizing your files doesn't have to be a daunting task. By taking some time to create an index, you can make it much easier to find what you need, when you need it. And, by keeping your file well-organized, you'll be able to work more efficiently and effectively. So, take some time to create an index for your files today. You'll be glad you did!

## What Do I Include In the File

Everything! How can anyone make decisions without complete, accurate information about your child? Print out every email. Request test results with the "actual test scores". You don't want a spreadsheet with the results, you want the acutal graded assessment. You can request a complete copy of your child's cummulative and confidential educational records including: medical records, special education records, formal and informal correspondence, disapline records, tests, evaluations, and teacher-to-teacher notes. There may be a cost and policy about photocopies.  

Schools keep records in different places. Information and reports can be misplaced. 

## Sic Vis Pacem Para Bellum

Assume that securing accomodations for ADHD through an IEP for your child will not happen without a hearing to resolve your dispute for accomodations. Assume the school refuses to provide your child with servies. What do you do? Special education disputes are resolved by due process hearings. A due process hearing is civil litigation. To prevail you need proof and evidence, just like you would in any court case. Your file is your repository of proof and evidence:
- letters written after meetings
- notes and transcripts of meetings
- test scores
- your journal
- your contact log of telephone calls
- reports, evaluations, & observations of your child (by independent experts)
- research reports
- newspaper articles
- school guidelines
- handbooks
- publications
- audits of your school system

To Avoid Conflict, Prepare for Conflict. If you enter a meeting prepared for a due process hearing then you have done your part as an advocate for your child. If you document the meeting and follow up with polite leters you have done your part as an advocate for your child. Anything less than that and you are relying on the school faculty to carry you. They might not. Sic vis pacem, para bellum is a latin adage that translates as "If you want peace, prepare for war."  The time to prepare is not when conflict is imminent but rather when times are peaceful. 

You prepare by maintaining the file as complete as possible with documentation. 

## Your Master Plan

In the next section, I am going to take you through the creation of your master plan. Project Management in its highest form is leadership. This is a leader's tool. The master plan is your tool to lead the IEP team to successful outcomes. It is a one-page document that includes vital information to help you successfully guide the team to positive outcomes for your child. The master plan should be filed in the front of your binder, right after the index.
