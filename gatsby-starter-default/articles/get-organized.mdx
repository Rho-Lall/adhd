If you're the parent of a student with ADHD, you know that accommodations can make all the difference in their success at school. But between work, home life, and everything else on your plate, it can be tough to stay organized and on top of everything. Having documentation at your fingertips is vital. Start early. You want to get organized and stay organized. Here are a wining strategy to help you out.

## BulletProof Document Management 

Get a three-ring binder for all of your child's school-related documents, and make sure to save everything in it related to their ADHD and education. This includes things like doctor's notes, assessment results, and email communications.

You will most likely want to group your documents together by putting all emails in one place and all assessments in another. However, resist the urge! Instead, try to imagine receiving an assessment from the doctor through email. Would you file it under 'assessments,' 'email,' or under the Doctor's name?

Keep everything chronological by dating it with a pencil (you may need to erase later). Do not write on originals- make copies instead and take notes separately on a sticky note attached to the document. Organize all of the documents in chronological order. Make careful not to damage important dates or signatures when you hole punch.

After they've been dated, index your papers. Resist the temptation to read them! Begin with the first document and work your way through all of the records in sequence. On a separate sheet of paper, make a note of the date, document name, and what it is: email, evaluation, letter, etc.

If you want to create categories you can do that in the index. Just create a list of the tags you wish to use to categorize each record. Turn to the next page in your records and add the second row to your index. Include a record for every document in your file. Now, when you need to find something, consult your index. 

**Four Rules for Organizing Your File**
- Do not write on original documents
- Do not use marker or highlighter on your original documents
- Do not release your original documents to anyone
- Keep your binder current

## Request Your Child's Records

Keep a running list of anyone who may have information or records pertaining to your child, and send them each a letter requesting copies of what they have. Be sure to explain that you're making the request in light of a school concern and that you need all the information to provide an appropriate education for your child. 

Request a complete copy of your child's entire cumulative file and confidential file from the school, omitting nothing. Expect to be charged a fee. Write two letters: one to the principal and another to the special education director.

## See the BIG Picture

When you read the records chronologically you will see the big picture. Usually, reports are written and filed away never to be read again. Few people review this information. Because no one sees the big picture plans are short-sighted.

If you want to get a sense of what is in your file, scan the index. You can see at a glance what topics are covered and how many documents there are on each topic. This will give you a good overview of the contents of your file.

Organizing your files doesn't have to be a daunting task. By taking some time to create an index, you can make it much easier to find what you need, when you need it. And, by keeping your file well-organized, you'll be able to work more efficiently and effectively. So, take some time to create an index for your files today. You'll be glad you did!

## What Do I Include In the File

All of it! If a school doesn't have accurate, precise information about your child, how can they make sound judgments? Print out every email. Schools keep records in different places. Records and reports have been known to get misplaced.

You may obtain a full copy of your child's entire educational record, including medical records, special education papers, formal and informal correspondence, discipline records, tests, evaluations, and teacher-to-teacher notes. You don't want a spreadsheet with test scores; ask for the actual graded assessment. There might be a charge and a policy concerning copies.

## Sic Vis Pacem Para Bellum

Assume that without a hearing to resolve your child's IEP-related difficulties, you will not be able to secure accommodations for ADHD. Assume that the school refuses to provide your child with services. What do you do? 

Due process hearings are formal means to resolve special education disputes. A due process hearing is civil litigation. You need evidence and proof in order to win, just like you would in any court proceeding. Your file is your evidence and proof of what has happened. Evidence can include:

- letters written after meetings
- notes and transcripts of meetings
- test scores
- your journal
- your contact log of telephone calls
- reports, evaluations, & observations of your child (by independent experts)
- research reports
- newspaper articles
- school guidelines
- handbooks
- publications
- audits of your school system

To Avoid Conflict, Prepare for Conflict. Sic vis pacem, para bellum is a latin adage that translates as "If you want peace, prepare for war." The time to prepare is not when conflict is imminent but rather when times are peaceful. 

If you enter a meeting prepared for a due process hearing then you have done your part as an advocate for your child. If you document the meeting and follow up with polite letters you have done your part as an advocate for your child. Anything less than that and you are relying on the school faculty to carry you. They might not. 


## What Do I Need?

You prepare by maintaining the file as complete as possible with documentation. You will need:

- (2) three ring notebooks.  One is to organize your child's documents. A second to organize your research to support your subject matter expertise. 
- three-hole punch
- highlighters
- sticky notes
- envelopes
- stamps
- calendar
- journal
- contact log
- audio recorder

## Your Master Plan

In the next section, I am going to take you through the creation of your one page OGSP. Project Management (one of the three hats you wear is Project Manager) in its highest form is leadership. This is a leader's tool. An OGSP is your tool to lead the IEP team to successful outcomes. It is a one-page document that includes vital information to help you successfully guide the team to positive outcomes for your child. The OGSP should be filed in the front of your binder, right after the index.
