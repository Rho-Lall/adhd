You can encounter resistance from the school at any point in the process. Off the bat the school could take the position that your child doesn't qualify for an IEP or even neglect to test your child. 
Having documentation at your fingertips is vital. Start early. You want to get organized and stay organized.


## BulletProof Document Management

You are going to put together a file of all of the documents and communications (email) related to your child's ADHD and education. 
Naturally, you are going to want to group documents together. Emails with emails. Assessments with assessments. Resist doing so.
Imagine you received an assessment from the doctor in an email. Is that filed with the assessments? Or email? Or is it under the Doctor's name?

You need to be able to access information on the fly . . . without (and this is key) relying on your memory.


If you're going to put together a file, organize all documents in chronological order. And then index them. First put all the documents in order. Resist the temptation to read them, that comes later.
Once they are in order, start with the first record. On a separate sheet of paper, write down the data, name of the document and what it is: email, assessment, letter, etc. 
If you want to create categories you can do that in the index. Just createa list of tags that you can use to categorize each record. Turn the page to your next record and add the second row to your index.
Include a record for every document in your file.

When you finish you now have an index of your file. Each document has a record. It's dated, it's titled and you can add whatever tags you want. Now the first few pages of your file 
is an index of the documents. You can get a very high level perspective and go through the entire file in a very short period of time.
All of that information is summarized in a few pages. When you need to find a document you can scan two or three pages very quickly to get to what you need.

## What Do I Include In The File

Everything! Print out every email. Request test results with the "actual test scores". You don't want a spreadsheet with the results, you want the acutal graded assessment.
You can request a complete copy of your child's cummulative and confidential educational records including: medical records, special education records, formal and informal correspondence, 
disapline records, tests, evaluations, and teacher-to-teacher notes. There may be a cost and policy about photocopies.


## Your Master Plan

In the next section I am going to take you through the creation of your master plan. This is a one page document ( at the absolute most). 
It encompases vital information to support you leading the IEP team to sucessful outcomes. Project Management in its highest form is leadership. This is a leader's tool.
File your master plan in the front of your binder, right after the index.
