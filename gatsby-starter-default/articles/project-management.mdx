## Bring Clarity to Chaos
 
As a project manager for your child's IEP team, it is essential for goals and objectives to be clear and concise. Your role is to bring clarity to the chaos and help everyone on the team stay focused on the task at hand. Every member of the IEP team has a role to play, and it is important that you understand what those roles are in order to provide accommodations for ADHD if needed. What follows is a discussion of three resources that will drive your IEP teams success. In the next section, IEP Team Members, Roles, and Responsibilities, we discuss the roles and responsibilities of each member of the IEP team including you, the parent. We will talk about what you can do to help the IEP team succeed. 

If you are looking for a way to improve your project management skills, scrum is a valuable tool to research and add to your tool kit. Project managment is a profession. I can't do it justice here. Setting proper goals is just one dimension of project management.

## Develop Page One

In the next section, Develop Page One, we talk about A tool leaders leverage to drive results and change behaviors. People don't care what you do, they care why you do it. In this section we discuss how to communicate in a way that will not only inspire yourself, but others as well.

## Accomodations for ADHD

The the last three sections we provide some ideas to help you brainstorm ideas for accomodations and specialized services that could help your child.


## The IEP Team

The IEP team is a vital to your child's education. With proper goals at the outset, the IEP team will be more effective and efficient in their work. When you clearly lay out goals chaos turns to clarity and everyone on the team can focus on the tasks at hand. You can require someone to do their job but you canâ€™t ask them to sacrifice. That has to come from them. Teachers are accustomed to sacrifice. It sets them appart from other professionals. Your role is to show them why their sacrifice matters. In the next section we are going to better understand the members of your team.
