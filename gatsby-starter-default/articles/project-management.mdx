As a project manager for your child's IEP team, it is essential for goals and objectives to be clear and concise. Your role is to bring clarity to the chaos and help everyone on the team stay focused on the task at hand. Every member of the IEP team has a role to play, and it is important that you understand what those roles are in order to provide accommodations for ADHD if needed. What follows will discuss the roles and responsibilities of each member of the IEP team, as well as how you can be an effective project manager for your child's success!

## IEP Team Members

The IEP team is made up of a variety of professionals, all with different roles and responsibilities. Here is a breakdown of who should be on your child's IEP team, and what their role is:
- You, the Parent: You are your child's best advocate! As a parent, you know your child better than anyone else on the team. You will be able to provide valuable insights into your child's strengths, weaknesses, and needs.
- The Teacher: The teacher is the professional who works with your child the most. They will be able to provide detailed information about your child's progress in school, as well as any challenges they may be having.
- The School Psychologist: The school psychologist can provide valuable information about your child's cognitive and emotional functioning. They can also administer assessments to help the team identify your child's strengths and needs.
- The Special Education Teacher: The special education teacher is a trained professional who can provide information about specialized instruction and accommodations for students with disabilities.
- The School Administrator: The school administrator is the person who oversees the entire school. They can provide information about district policies and procedures, as well as advocate for your child at the district level.

Special education team members roles and responsibilities include providing support to special needs students, developing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and collaborating with parents, teachers, and other professionals. They work to ensure that special needs students have access to the resources and services they need to succeed in school and in life sometimes providing direct instruction and support to students. In addition, special education team members monitor special needs students' progress and keep track of their IEP goals.

When it comes to Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), general education teachers are essential. In order to ensure that all students have a free appropriate public education, general education teachers must be actively involved in the development and implementation of IEPs. While special education teachers are typically responsible for creating IEPs, general education teachers play a key role in providing input and ensuring that the goals of the IEP are realistic and achievable. In addition, general education teachers are responsible for providing instruction and support to students with IEPs in the general education classroom. By working collaboratively with special education teachers, general education teachers can help ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.

The administrator provides valuable insight and perspective on how best to meet the student's individual needs. Administrators help ensure all members of the IEP team are on the same page and working together towards a common goal. In addition, administrators can offer support and guidance to parents and guardians who may be new to the IEP process. As such, administrator involvement in IEP meetings is essential to ensuring that your child receives the services and accommodations they need.

## Effective Project Managment

Project Management is hard. The key is getting specific and clear. Vague is the enemy. Vague derails your team. Effective project managers clearly define success, the work to be done as well as the roles of those who will do it. As an advocate and a parent it is easy to see you are serving the interest of your child. You want your child to succeed. As a project manager your a serving the interest of the IEP team. You want the IEP team to succeed. The that end I want to introduce you to the Scrum methodology. Scrum is used with wild success in a variety of fields and applications including education.

## Scrum in School

Scrum is a project management methodology that is often used in software development. It has wide applicabilty to organize any work that needs to be done. I first heard about Scrum working for a software company. My team was able to get our work done more effectively, without grinding the team down. I found scrum to be very helpful in managing our work.   It consists of short cycles, called sprints, during which a specific goal is achieved. It allowed us to break down our work into manageable tasks, and it helped us to stay on track and meet our deadlines. Scrum is a great tool for educators.

When I first started learning scrum, I would see developers with these massive certification manuals on their desks. It was intimidating at first. Then I realized, I'm not trying to get certified, I'm just trying to get work done. Paradoxically, the strength of scrum is that it is simple. The scrum framework provides a flexible and adaptive structure that helps teams focus on delivering value. Scrum is NOT a collection of complicated rules and procedures that must be followed to the letter. Rather, it is a set of principles that guide team behavior and interactions. While there is a lot of training and materials available on scrum, the most important thing is to keep the scrum value of people first. Remember that Scrum is about people and collaboration, not process and documentation.

## The Backlog

The scrum backlog is a simple but essential tool for any scrum team. It's just a list. Simply a list of all the work that needs to be done in order to complete the project. The backlog can be used to track progress, identify blockers, and ensure that everyone is on the same page. In addition, the scrum backlog is used to prioritize work and ensure that the most important tasks are listed first so they are completed next. The backlog is an essential part of scrum because it helps to keep the team organized and focused on the goal.

## The Kanban Board

The kanban board is used to keep track of progress on what you are working on right now. Each task is represented by a card, which is moved across the board as it progresses through to completion. There are many kanban software programs available, but I would recommend Trello. Trello is simple to use and has a variety of features that can be customized to fit your needs.

A scrum kanban board is typically divided into four sections: To Do, Doing, Blocked, and Done. Each section represents a different stage in the scrum process. To do is the first stage, where tasks are identified and assigned to team members. Doing is the second stage, where team members work on the tasks. Blocked is the third stage, where tasks are blocked for some reason (for example, waiting for input from another team member). Done is the fourth and final stage, where tasks are completed and moved off the board. By dividing the board into these four sections, scrum teams can more easily track their progress and ensure that tasks are completed efficiently.

## The Sprint

Scrum defines the concept of a sprint. Depending on the nature of the work, the sprint can be weekly, monthly, or somewhere in-between. Two weeks is common. The team gets together at the beginning of each sprint to discuss the next sprint and what work they will commit to doing. Then, at the end of the sprint, the team circles back to discuss how the sprint went and how the team can collaborate more effectively in future sprints. This process helps scrum teams continuously improve their workflow and deliverables.

Scrum encourages teams to break large projects down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This makes work easier because it is more focused and specific. In addition, scrum forces teams to communicate frequently, which helps to prevent problems from snowballing out of control. One of the key benefits of scrum is that it helps to keep team members on track by clearly defining what needs to be done and when it needs to be done. It provides visibility on who is working on what, and if anything is "stuck". As a result, scrum can be an essential tool for ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget.

The IEP team is a vital part of your child's education. Using scrum, the IEP team can be more effective and efficient in their work. This project management methodology brings clarity to the chaos and helps everyone on the team stay focused on the tasks at hand. If you are looking for a way to improve your project management skills, scrum may be the answer for you.
