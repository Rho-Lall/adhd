## masterful planning

Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. John Wooden. You see LA basketball. 

I don't know. So I don't want to make the same mistake because I feel like I'm writing a book with a specific purpose. And I'm also getting derailed talking about values and mission and vision, and it's just what the hell. Don't want to put my readers through the same thing. 

Don't want for example. Hey before you can go, find it new job or get higher in a job. You need to do all this life. Searching to figure out your life purpose. No, I don't other people get jobs. Other people with far less character than me Get jobs. So, no, I don't need to do. 

All I can do all the soul searching on my own time. I've got something that I need to get done. This stuff can wait. Also by it's just this book, just assumes that I haven't done this stuff already, right? Like it talks about gathering other information like test scores and stuff. 

And it's like, hey, here's how you get the different documents but it doesn't treat emissions statement. It doesn't, it doesn't treat these like documents and it doesn't even say to put them in the file or if it does. I missed that part but these things, I'm guessing these things should go in the file. 

And I guess these elements are needed for leadership. These are the tools of a leader. 

When you're a leader vague is the enemy. You need to create clarity and if you can paint a picture of the future, that's your vision. People can see that this certainly in their mind and they know what they're working towards. Mission statement talks about a personal statement that describes the reasons you're advocating for your child. 

So values, right? This is why this is start with y, but I think a mission statement is different than Than why? And I feel like, Simon Sinek Articulated that but I don't remember what he said. So, those first two vision and mission those are leadership. Go is project management. 

Timelines is project management strategies. I think is a hybrid, it can be leadership, it can be project management, right? You can have a leader who sets out different strategies as rails. That a project manager can use, right? When you encounter this problem to this, right? You can create playbooks. 

Not saying these things don't have their place, but I think 

I guess the problem I don't have a problem with what they said, but the words right vision statement mission statement? I think they're just too highfalutant their buzzwords goals strategies timelines. Those are pretty innocuous but mission statement and vision statement I think it's just implies a bigger picture than is really what we're talking about. 

Like you don't need to have your whole life figured out. You don't need to have a life vision and a life purpose but your your project should have some type of vision statement. Maybe call it something else and it should have right. You should have a statement of what your values are because people are going to coalesce around your values. 

Teachers and not just teachers. But anybody is going to be, people aren't going to buy into what you do, they're going to buy into why you do it. And so if you can articulate the values that you hold and assuming they have the same values, right? In this case, I think it's the education of your child. 

That is a common value. 

That's something you can rally around. And this should be one page at the most this whole thing. Probably doesn't even have to be a whole page. It could probably be a half page.


Isn't it? Usually the villain that has a master plan, I don't know that. That's an aim to well. So planning master planning helps, you focus and dissipate problems and prepare for the future. 

The need to plan. What do you want your child to achieve this year? What are your long-range goals for your child? What do you want your child to be able to do when he or she leaves the public school system? What steps do you need to take to help your child meet these goals? 

What are your child's strengths and weaknesses? 

A master plan will help you work more efficiently. Stay focused, anticipate problems and prepare for the future. Wow, repetitive much. 

A master plan is different from an IEP. The IEP is not a long-term plan. The IEP includes annual goals and short-term objectives. It is focused on now and the present a master plan in contrast 

Has a longer. 

Is is for the long term. 

The elements of a master plan include vision statement, mission statement, goals, strategies and timelines. You know, I value this stuff and I think I'm guilty of this too which is why it's working me because I I'm currently working on a project and I feel like I'm doing the same thing. 

I feel like this is bullshit. 

And I get the need for it but I don't think this is the time in place, I don't know. They mean they dedicated ten pages to this Diablo. 

All right, and just work through it. Vision statement is a visual picture that describes your child's future. What does your child need to be prepared for future education employment and independent living? 

A mission statement is a personal statement that describes the reasons. You are advocating for your child goals, stretch, direct and focus you and help you maintain perspective. A good goal will be quote, my child will be able to blank and quote. What do you expect your child to learn this year? Next year?

 Strategies help you make decisions. Solve problems and overcome obstacles. Think of strategies as a roadmap timelines or statements, about what actions need to be completed. When? 

Planning for the future. Imagine your child is the young adult. What do you want for your child? What should your child be able to do? 

So again, this is not the that's not terrible and it's nice to have something a little bit more specific but I just I don't like I don't like any of that. And again, this chapter, it just looks like hodgepodge. Regurgitation of things that have already been said, writing your master plan, which they've already identified as a forward looking document. 

That's very kind of like bullshit, but now they're talking about gathering information. Gather information about your child, your child's disability, how to disability affect your child's ability to learn? We've talked about that in chapter 9, you will learn how to request information about your child, to organize your child's file, which is useful chapter, 9's great. 

But again, why are we talking about that here? I it's not a parent. Your master plan should include academic and non-academic goals the gain, by writing your goals. In non-academic, areas hobbies, sports fitness social life family community, the church has their child goal index, right? You can use that to 


## Project Management

Use a scrum framework. Where's my scrum stuff? I have scrum stuff. You need identify things in terms of an objective, which is Essentially, a user story. Set, objective needs to be tied to a KPI. 

Or a key result. There's a difference between the two KPIs or more like test scores, A key result is a specific measurable achievement. Once you identify The objectives or objectives, but not more than two objectives. Then you work with the team, to identify the steps to accomplish that objective. 

And you write all that down? Identify milestones to achieve the objective and he said to date, Then you need to assign a stroke chokeable throat. Then you need to assign a chokeable throat. That is where and RACI matrix comes in. And then the key to fantastic project management. 

Is the ability to push politely. Effective project managers know that it's a two-way street. They keep the lines of communication, open a lesson. 

For feedback, both positive and negative. They don't look to blame, they don't look to judge. They encourage people to communicate quickly, and clearly. So that when things go sideways, they can respond effectively without judgment or plan Blame. And finally, they know how to provide pressure. Politely can't count the number of times, a project manager, a specific project manager. 

Not all of them. A handful too. Project managers needed something done and they stood in my cubicle until it was done. They were nice. They were friendly but they didn't leave and I hated that shit. 

And I told them. 

Because we were friends, they took the time to cultivate a relationship of open communication. And I told them not many project, managers will do what you do. But because you do that it gets done because I don't want you my cubicle and you're here and so I'm gonna do it. 

So you can leave that's just human mechanics. 

I think there's some honorable mention on scope creep. And understanding the iron triangle. I think there's Appreciating scrum versus waterfall techniques. Understanding the theory of constraints and critical change, but these aren't essential to this task at hand and I don't mean to water down or minimize the effects and what a project manager does. 

But this is just like the core core of what makes for effective project management is by, no means exhaustive and a good product. This is a skill that's worth learning. It's worth reading about scrum and understanding how to manage an effective scrum is worth reading project management, professional training materials.

## Why do projects fail?

The most common reasons projects fail are:
- lack of planning
- fuzzy goals
- team members who do not know what is expected of them
- eam members, who do not get training and support
- team members who feel overburdened and underappreciated


## Setting SMART IEP Goals

Does the law specifically mention SMART methodology in the development of goals? 

There's a lot of time dedicated to the proper way to set goals and they don't offer anything novel or interesting. It's just the smart model applied to the setting and they don't even apply it to, an education setting. They use weight loss as an example, and it's just terrible.

Can we create a solid resource on goal setting utilizing OKRs and the best of what is current knowledge?
