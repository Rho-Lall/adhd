## Setting SMART IEP Goals

Does the law specifically mention SMART methodology in the development of goals? 

There's a lot of time dedicated to the proper way to set goals and they don't offer anything novel or interesting. It's just the smart model applied to the setting and they don't even apply it to, an education setting. They use weight loss as an example, and it's just terrible.

Can we create a solid resource on goal setting utilizing OKRs and the best of what is current knowledge?

## A BulletProof Document Management System

That's useful. So the first thing they offered was if you're going to put together a file, you want to store the data like paperwork. If you have document, document storage documents storage, 101 store, your documents and chronological order, and then index them. So, whatever categories you are going to put them in right to. 

Because that's the natural thing that you want to do is you want to put emails with emails and assessments with assessments and and that kind of a thing instead of physically putting them and categories, create an index and assign tags. So each document is a record. It's dated, it's titled and you can add whatever tags you want. 

And so, when you do that, your first few pages of your file is an index of the documents and you can get a very high level perspective and go through the entire dock, the entire file in a very short period of time because all of that information is summarized in a few pages and then you can scan two or three pages very quickly to get to what you need to find and it's not beholden to remembering. 

Did I file, you know, I received an assessment from the doctor in an email. Is that filed under assessment? Is that filed under email? Is it filed under something else? Right? The doctors name or something like that. 

So that seemed to come from a place of knowledge and experience and was useful.
