The IEP team is a vital to your child's education. Using Scrum the IEP team will be more effective and efficient in their work. This project management methodology brings clarity to the chaos and helps everyone on the team stay focused on the tasks at hand. If you are looking for a way to improve your project management skills, scrum is a valuable tool to add to your tool kit. But that might not be enough. You can require someone to do their job but you canâ€™t ask them to sacrifice. That has to come from them. Teachers are accustomed to sacrifice. It sets them appart from other professionals. Your role is to show them why their sacrifice matters.
