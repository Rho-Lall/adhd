>Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. ~ John Wooden, UCLA basketball.

## Why do projects fail?

The most common reasons projects fail are:
- lack of planning
- fuzzy goals
- team members who do not know what is expected of them
- team members, who do not get training and support
- team members who feel overburdened and underappreciated

## Bring Clarity to Chaos

As a project manager for your child's IEP team, it is essential for goals and objectives to be clear and concise. Your role is to bring clarity to the chaos and help everyone on the team stay focused on the task at hand. Every member of the IEP team has a role to play, and it is important that you understand what those roles are in order to secure specialized education and accommodations for ADHD as needed. 

What follows is a discussion of three resources that will drive your IEP team's success. In the next section, IEP Team Members, Roles, and Responsibilities, we discuss the roles and responsibilities of each member of the IEP team including you, the parent. We will talk about what you can do to help the IEP team succeed. 

## Develop Page One

In a previous section, Develop Page One, we talk about a tool leaders leverage to drive results and change behaviors. People don't care what you do, they care why you do it. In this section, we discuss how to communicate in a way that will not only inspire yourself but others as well.

## Accommodations for ADHD

Here we provide some ideas to help you brainstorm ideas for accommodations for ADHD and specialized services that could help your child.

## The IEP Team

The IEP team is vital to your child's education. With proper goals at the outset, the IEP team will be more effective and efficient in their work. When you clearly lay out goals chaos turns to clarity and everyone on the team can focus on the tasks at hand. You can require someone to do their job but you canâ€™t ask them to sacrifice. That has to come from them. Teachers are accustomed to sacrifice. It sets them apart from other professionals. Your role is to show them why their sacrifice matters. In the next section, we are going to better understand the members of your team.

Setting proper goals is just one dimension of project management. If you are looking for a way to improve your project management skills, SCRUM is a valuable tool to research and add to your tool kit. Project management is a profession. I can't do it justice here.
