If you think your child may have ADHD, the first step is to request an IEP evaluation from your schoo. An IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is a document that outlines accommodations and other supports that will be put in place to help your child succeed in school. Accommodations for adhd can include things like extra time for tests, preferential seating, and breaks during class. They are based on each child's unique needs and are meant to ensure your child’s access to a free appropriate public education. Accommodations for students with adhd can make a big difference in their ability to learn and succeed in school. Don't hesitate to ask for an IEP evaluation if you think your child may benefit from one. 

As a parent

## Requesting Testing for IEP

As a parent, you have [the right to request](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/B) the school evaluate your ADHD elementary student to determine:
- if your child is a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3)
- the educational needs that arise from your child's ADHD. 

The school must complete the evaluation [within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/C/i). When federal law creates a timeline in "days" this means calendar days, not school days. Some states may have statutes or regulations that permit longer timelines.

Parental consent is required for the school to test your child. The date you sign starts the 60 day clock for completing the evaluation. When requesting testing for IEP just ask at the front desk. There could be other documents you need to fill out as well. At the very least you will need to sign a release. Ask for copies of everything. If you get pushback, just ask for the documents that you need to fill out so you can get started on them. If they don't know what to do, they will know who to ask.

If you still get pushback, make the request in writting. Or just write the letter in advance and give it to them when you make your request. It is as simple as stating, 
>"I would like to have my child tested for an IEP. I made my request at the front desk on such-and-such date. I am following up that request with this letter."

Screening a student by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies is not the same as [an evaluation for eligibility for special education](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/E) and related services. It's a significant process that involves [a variety of assessment tools and strategies](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/2/A).



## IEP Testing Process
## IEP Psychological Testing
## IEP Evaluation Tests

Now thay you have given consent to have your child tested for an IEP the process begins. The school must provide notice that describes the evaluation proceedures they propose to conduct. 

The process requires [a variety of assessment tools and strategies](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/2/A) to gather information about your child's academic ability as well as functional and developmental ability. The scope of information gathering strategies at the school's disposal includes information provided by you, the parent. The school cannot rely on [any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion]() for making a determination. The school must use a variety of technically sound instruments to assess the relative contribution of these factors: cognitive, behavioral, physical, and developmental.

**Determination of Eligibility** The aim of this assessment is two fold, to determine:
- is your child a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3)
- the educational needs of your child

You, the parent, need to be given a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility.

A diagnosis of ADHD is not sufficient to meet requirement for eligibility. The evaluation needs to also show educational need. The key phrase is "who by reason thereof, needs special education and related services." If your child has ADHD but doesn't need special education services, your child is not eligible for serivces under IDEA but may be eligible for protections under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

**Child with A Disability** Among the specific list of conditions given in the definition for a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3) is "specific learning disabilities". The term “[specific learning disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/30)” means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which disorder may manifest itself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations. 

On the short list of included disorders is "minimal brain dysfunction" which is now called Attention Deficit Disorder, ADD. Congress choose to not change the language of the original definition written in 1970. Many terms used to describe disabilities in IDEA are those used in the 1970's. 

In 2004 Congress did change the language about evaluations for specific learning disabilities: [the school is no longer required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/6)". Schools do not have to find a discrepancy between IQ and educational achievement to find a child with a specific learning disability eligible for special education services. This is consistent with the requirement for a determination based in the relative contribution of these factors: behavioral, physical, developmental, & not just congnitive.

The IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate review existing evaluation data on the child, including:
- evaluations and information **provided by the parents** of the child;
- current classroom-based, local, or State assessments, and classroom-based observations
- observations by teachers and related services providers

On the basis of that review, **and input from the child’s parents**, the IEP team will identify what additional data, if any, is needed to determine —
- whether your child is a child with a disability as defined in section 1401(3)
- the educational needs of your child
- the present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of your child
- whether your child needs special education and related services to participate, as appropriate, in the general education curriculum
