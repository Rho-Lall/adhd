Your child is struggling in school. Do you want to help, but don't know how? Request your child be assessed for an IEP. This will help determine if their education is being negatively impacted by a disability through a formal evaluation and review of data.

An IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is a document that outlines accommodations and other supports to help your child succeed in school. Accommodations for ADHD can include things like extra time for tests, preferential seating, and breaks during class. They are based on each child's unique needs and are meant to ensure your childâ€™s access to a free appropriate public education. Accommodations for students with ADHD can make a big difference in their ability to learn and succeed in school.

You may feel powerless as a parent when it comes to dealing with the school. You are not helpless, even if you believe you are. The remedy for helplessness is information. Knowledge is your power.

> Parents have become so convinced that educators know what is best for children that they forget that they are the experts. ~ Marian Wright Edelman, educator

You can't create a strategy until you've figured out (1) where you are and (2) where you need to go. Step one, request testing for an IEP.

## Requesting Testing for IEP

As a parent, you have [the right to request](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/B) that the school evaluate your ADHD elementary student to determine:

- if your child is a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3)
- the educational needs that arise from your child's ADHD

The school must complete the evaluation [within 60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/a/1/C/i). When federal law creates a timeline in "days" this means calendar days, not school days. Some states may have statutes or regulations that permit longer timelines.

Parental consent is required for the school to test your child. The date you sign starts the 60 day clock for completing the evaluation. When requesting testing for IEP just ask at the front desk. There could be other documents you need to fill out as well. At the very least you will need to sign a release. Ask for copies of everything. If you get pushback, just ask for the documents that you need to fill out so you can get started on them. If they don't know what to do, they will know who to ask.

If you still get pushback, make the request in writing. Or just write the letter in advance and give it to them when you make your request. It is as simple as stating, 

>"I would like to have my child tested for an IEP. I made my request at the front desk on a such-and-such date. I am following up that request with this letter."

The first step to getting accommodations for your ADHD elementary student is to request an IEP evaluation from the school. This evaluation will determine if your child has a disability and what his or her educational needs are. The school must complete this evaluation within 60 days of receiving parental consent, so it is important to act quickly. You can make this request in person, and / or in writing.
