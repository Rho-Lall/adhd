## Why does it matter?

Leaders leverage their vision and values to drive results and change behavior. People don't care what you do, they care why you do it. Project managment helps teams communicate and work together to do what needs doing. While project managment cannot answer the question, why are we doing this? A project manager can.

Page One is a statement of your values and beliefs related to the IEP. The IEP is a manifestation of your belief. Why are you here? Why does your work matter? Is your child's education important? Why does it matter?

The second half of page one is a clear vision of what you are working towards. What success looks like.

## I Believe

As a parent, I believe A good education, is the most important gift I can give my child. As a professional, I believe work is noble. When I aspire to do the best work I can, it allows others to do the same and we are all better for it. 

DEVELOPING THIS IDEA Descrive your childâ€™s future as you see it. Paint a picture we can see in our mind, that's your vision. If the IEP team can see that this certainly in their minds they will see what they are working towards. Here are some questions to get you thinking:
- What does your child need to be prepared for future education employment and independent living?
- What do you want your child to achieve this year?
- What are your long-range goals for your child?
- What do you want your child to be able to do when he or she leaves the public school system?
- What steps do you need to take to help your child meet these goals? 
- What are your child's strengths and weaknesses?
- Imagine your child is the young adult. What do you want for your child?
- What does your child do?
