The biggest strength of the status quo is that it is comfortable. People know what to do, what to expect, and they can't get in trouble sticking with the status quo. This makes it a safe choice for many people, because it minimizes risk. This comes at a cost, being, there is little incentive to change or improve things. People become complacent. When things are running smoothly, there is no reason to rock the boat. This can lead to stagnation and a lack of innovation. Furthermore, without change or improvement, the status quo becomes entrenched.

The thing is, your child doesn't fit neatly into that entrenched framework. They're creative, they think outside the box, and they see things differently than the status quo. In order to nurture those qualities and help them thrive, you propose to go against the grain and challenge the status quo. Not an easy task. But is it worth it?

Coming up with new ideas and proposals, there is always risk involved. Risk that things may not work out as planned, that things may get worse rather than better. Risk of paperwork, of having to go through the process of getting buy-in and approval for change. Sometimes change is necessary. Necessary for growth, for innovation, for progress. Sometimes it isn't. How do you make the case for change in the face of these risks?

## Where SMART Goals Come Up Short.

Goal setting is usually taught using the SMART method, which stands for: 

- Specific
- Measurable 
- Achievable 
- Relevant 
- Time Bound

That isn't a bad place to start. If building an OGSP seems daunting, start with a couple of SMART goals. SMART is great for personal goals and applications, but it doesn't have the same effect for leading a team because other people will not find motivation in your personal goals.

## Leading By Objectives

An OGSP or One Page Strategic Plan is a simple, yet powerful way to keep your objectives top of mind and relevant to your team. It makes objectives easy to find so you know what you are working towards. It identifies the right things to work on. And it provides a yardstick to measure success, so the right things are done right.

> "Management by objective works - if you know the objectives. Ninety percent of the time you don't." ~ Peter Drucker

Creating a strategy boils down to two tasks. First, clearly and simply define what sucess looks like and how will resources be allocated to deliver success. Second, make real choices about where you want to focus and how you will win.

-  **"What”** success looks like for your team
-  **"How”** your team will allocate its limited resources to deliver that success
-  **“Where will you Focus?”**  You can't tackle everything. Even if you can, you can't do it all at the same time. It's too much. Where are you going to focus your effort?
-  **“How you will Win”** We start with framing a successful outcome, what does success look like for your team? Define what "Done!" means. We follow this up with, "What is the next action?" What does doing look like? You get to mark this as done when what is true?

The OGSP is a one-page template to help you answer these questions. It has five sections: Your Why, Objective, Goals, Strategies, & Plans.

**Your Why.** Why does your objective matter. To you? Why it matter to others? This is a concise and compelling statement of your belief and values.

**Objective.** One sentence that describes what winning looks like. Paint a picture we can see in our mind. This is your vision.

**Goals.** These are quantifiable metrics which track progress on any commitments that are made in the Objective statement.

**Strategies.** A strategy defines success by allocating your limited resources to the highest potential areas.  Each Strategy sentence on the OGSP page typically captures elements of where you focus effort and how you will win. To drive greater focus the process limits you to no more than five total strategies: 4 of which are typically focused on the child and a 5th devoted to building internal capability, training, team development.

**Plans.** These are the most critical initiatives/projects that you will do next. Each Plan must have a single-point accountable Owner and a defined month/year Due Date.  We suggest no more than 3-4 Plans per Strategy at any given time to again drive focus.

## Statement of Purpose, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act

Use Section 1400(d) as a starting point for your own Why statment when drafting an IEP or creating a long-term plan for your child.

>To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living

>To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected

>To assist States, localities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of all children with disabilities

>To assist States in the implementation of a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families

>To ensure that educators and parents have the necessary tools to improve educational results for children with disabilities by supporting system improvement activities; coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology development and media services

>To assess, and ensure the effectiveness of, efforts to educate children with disabilities

## Why Does It Matter?

People don't care what you do, they care why you do it. Leaders leverage their vision and values to drive results and change behavior. Project management helps teams communicate and work together to do what needs doing. While project management cannot answer the question, why are we doing this? A project manager can.

The OGSP is a statement of your values and beliefs related to the IEP. The IEP is a manifestation of your belief. Why are you here? Why does your work matter? Is your child's education important? Why does it matter?

The OGSP is also a clear vision of what you are working towards. What success looks like.

## I Beleive

As a parent, I believe A good education, is the most important gift I can give my child. 

As a professional, I believe work is noble. When I aspire to the best work I can do, it gives others permission to do the same. We are all better for it. 

## Some Ideas To Get You Started

Here are some questions you can answer to get you started. This will probably not all make it into your OGSP but it will provide the seeds for ideas that will. Describe your child’s future as you see it. Paint a picture we can see in our mind, that's your vision. If the IEP team can see this clearly in their minds they will see what they are working towards.

Here are some questions to get you thinking:

- What does your child need to be prepared for future education employment and independent living?
- What do you want your child to achieve this year?
- What are your long-range goals for your child?
- What do you want your child to be able to do when he or she leaves the public school system?
- What steps do you need to take to help your child meet these goals? 
- What are your child's strengths and weaknesses?
- Imagine your child as a young adult. What do you want for your child?
- What does your child do?

Creating and following through with a clear vision for your child is one of the most important things you can do as a parent or guardian. Having a plan and working towards a common goal will help ensure that your child receives the best education possible. The OGSP can help provide this vision by outlining your beliefs and values related to the IEP process. It can also provide a clear vision of what you want your child to achieve in the future.
