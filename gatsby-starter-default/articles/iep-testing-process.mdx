Now thay you have given consent to have your child tested for an IEP the process begins. The school must provide notice that describes the evaluation proceedures they propose to conduct. 

Before you go into your evaluation review meeting, be sure to know the answers to these questions:

- What is the eligibility criteria for an IEP? What are the local laws, and school board policies?
- What tests did the school administer to my child?
- Am I familiar with the result format of these tests?

## IEP Testing Process

The process requires [a variety of assessment tools and strategies](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/2/A) to gather information about your child's academic ability as well as functional and developmental ability. The scope of information gathering strategies at the school's disposal includes information provided by you, the parent. The school cannot rely on [any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion]() for making a determination. The school must use a variety of technically sound instruments to assess the relative contribution of these factors: cognitive, behavioral, physical, and developmental.

**Determination of Eligibility** The aim of this assessment is two fold, to determine:
- is your child a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3)
- the educational needs of your child

You, the parent, need to be given a copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility.

A diagnosis of ADHD is not sufficient to meet requirement for eligibility. The evaluation needs to also show educational need. The key phrase is "who by reason thereof, needs special education and related services." If your child has ADHD but doesn't need special education services, your child is not eligible for serivces under IDEA but may be eligible for protections under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

**Child with A Disability** Among the specific list of conditions given in the definition for a [child with a disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/3) is "specific learning disabilities". The term “[specific learning disability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-i/1401/30)” means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which disorder may manifest itself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations. 

On the short list of included disorders is "minimal brain dysfunction" which is now called Attention Deficit Disorder, ADD. Congress choose to not change the language of the original definition written in 1970. Many terms used to describe disabilities in IDEA are those used in the 1970's. 

In 2004 Congress did change the language about evaluations for specific learning disabilities: [the school is no longer required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statute-chapter-33/subchapter-ii/1414/b/6)". Schools do not have to find a discrepancy between IQ and educational achievement to find a child with a specific learning disability eligible for special education services. This is consistent with the requirement for a determination based in the relative contribution of these factors: behavioral, physical, developmental, & not just congnitive.

The IEP Team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate review existing evaluation data on the child, including:
- evaluations and information **provided by the parents** of the child;
- current classroom-based, local, or State assessments, and classroom-based observations
- observations by teachers and related services providers

On the basis of that review, **and input from the child’s parents**, the IEP team will identify what additional data, if any, is needed to determine —
- whether your child is a child with a disability as defined in section 1401(3)
- the educational needs of your child
- the present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of your child
- whether your child needs special education and related services to participate, as appropriate, in the general education curriculum

The evaluation for special education services must determine if a child has a disability and what the educational needs of the child are. A diagnosis of ADHD is not sufficient to meet the requirements for eligibility, the evaluation must also show educational need. The definition of a child with a disability includes specific learning disabilities, among which is ADD. The school is no longer required to take into consideration whether a child has a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability to find a child with a specific learning disability eligible for special education services. The IEP team and other qualified professionals, as appropriate, will review existing evaluation data on the child and identify what additional data, if any, is needed.
