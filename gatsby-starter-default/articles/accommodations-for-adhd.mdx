## accommodations for adhd

To start your learning about accommodations for ADHD, there are a few things you need to know. First, accommodations aren't one-size-fits-all - what works for one student might not work for another. Second, accommodations can be divided into two main categories: academic and behavioral. Third, accommodations should be individualized to meet the specific needs of the student. In this section, we'll discuss accommodations for ADHD in more detail, including specific examples of each type of accommodation.
