To start your learning about accommodations for ADHD, there are a few things you need to know. First, accommodations aren't one-size-fits-all - what works for one student might not work for another. Second, accommodations can be divided into two main categories: academic and behavioral. Third, accommodations should be individualized to meet the specific needs of the student. In this section, we'll discuss accommodations for ADHD in more detail, including specific examples of each type of accommodation.



## Qualifying for Accommodations for ADHD VS Specialized Education


Before we can discuss accommodations, we have to be clear on qualifying for services. Your child doesn't get services if they don't qualify. Learn more here about qualifying for IEPs and 504s. In many cases, Section 504 children are eligible for services under IDEA.



The rule of thumb between IEPs & 504s comes down to one word: accommodations. An IEP includes specialized services, modifications, and accommodations. If your child simply needs accommodations in order to access the general education curriculum then a 504 will be implemented. If however, general education is inappropriate on insufficient in meeting your child's needs an IEP is appropriate.



Don't use the term "accommodation for ADHD" when a modification is appropriate. You may inadvertently pigeonhole your child into a 504 plan when an IEP is warranted. To learn more about qualifying for IEPs and 504s, click here.

## Accommodations for ADHD or Modifications for ADHD, what is the difference?
**Accommodations.** An accommodation is a tool or procedure that provides equal access to instruction and assessment for students with disabilities. Accommodations are provided to “level the playing field" by ensuring access to the same materials and activities, but with some variation in time, format, setting, and/or presentation. An accommodation is meant to give a kid with special needs equal access to learning and an equal opportunity to show what he knows and can do.



Accommodations are divided into four categories:

- Variations in time: adapting the time allotted for learning, task completion, or testing
- Variation of input: adapting the way instruction is delivered
- Variation of output: adapting how a student can respond to instruction
- Variation of size: adapting the number of items the student is expected to complete

Accommodations are not intended to reduce the expectations for students with ADHD, but rather to help them access classroom instruction and participate fully in assessments.



**Modifications.** Content modifications refer to changes in the instructional level, content, or performance criteria. Modifications are changes in what students are expected to learn, based on their individual abilities. Some examples of modifications that can be made are using different books, having the option to pass or not, rewording questions in simpler language, and giving feedback to students on a daily basis.



When deciding between appropriate accommodations and modifications for your child, ask these questions:

- Can your child participate in the activity in the same way as her peers?
- If not, can she do the same activity with adapted materials?
- If not, can she do the same activity with adapted expectations and materials?
- If not, can she accomplish the goals of the lesson by working with a partner or small group?
- If not, can she do the same activity with intermittent assistance from an adult?
- If not, can she do the same activity with direct adult assistance?
- If not, can she do a different, parallel activity?

## Accommodations for ADHD
Accommodations for ADHD must be individualized in order to meet the needs of each student. This means that the accommodations will be different for each student, in order to place them at an equal starting level with their non-disabled peers and allow for differences in learning styles. 

## Environmental Accommodations for ADHD


Make adjustments to the student’s environment: 

- Provide a structured learning environment. 

- Provide space with minimal distraction. 

- Adjust class schedule.

- Provide classroom aides and note takers. 

- Modify nonacademic times such as lunchroom and recess. 

- Modify physical education. 

- Change student seating. 

- Organize student’s study tools. 

- Alter the location of personal or classroom supplies for easier access, or to minimize distractions. 

## Organizational Accommodations for ADHD
Make adjustments to lessons, assignments and testing:



- Extra time to complete tasks. 

- Shorten assignments; break work into smaller segments. 

- Allow computer-printed assignments. 

- Modify test delivery. 

- Use tape recorders, computer-aided instruction, and other audiovisual equipment. 

- Select modified textbooks or workbooks. 

- Tailor homework assignments. 

- Provide peer tutoring. 

- Set time expectations for assignments. 

- Provide tests in segments so that student finishes one segment before receiving the next part. 

- Highlight the main ideas and supporting details in the book.



## Behavioral Accommodations for ADHD
Positive Behavioral Supports:

- Include a variety of activities in each lesson. 

- Repeat and simplify instructions about assignments. 

- Supplement oral instructions with visual instructions. 

- Change the instructional pace. 

- Change instructional methods.

## Curriculum Accommodations for ADHD
Make adjustments to the type, amount, and presentation of materials:

 

- Assess whether the student has the necessary prerequisite skills. Determine whether materials are appropriate to the student's current interest and functioning levels. 

- Use supplementary materials. 

- Implement study skill strategies (survey, read, recite, review). Introduce definitions of new terms/vocabulary and review to check for understanding. 

- Limit the amount of material presented on a single page. 

- Provide a sample or practice test. 

- Be aware of the student's preferred learning style and provide appropriate instruction/materials.

## Specially Designed Instruction
Specially designed instruction means adapting as appropriate to the needs of an eligible student, the content, methodology or delivery of grade-level core instruction in order to:



- Address the unique needs of the student that result from the student’s disability

- Ensure the student’s access to the grade level curriculum, so that he/she can meet the educational standards within the school district that applies to all students

- Provide access to the alternate core standards for qualifying students based on IEP team decisions 

## Supplementary Aids & Services
Supplementary aids and services are aids, services, and other supports provided in regular education classes or other education-related settings to enable students with disabilities to be educated with children who do not have disabilities to the maximum extent appropriate, including participation in extracurricular and nonacademic activities. These are determined individually for each child, and they are able to include direct services and supports to the student, as well as support and training for the professionals that work with the student. 

## Assistive Technologies
**Devices** Any item, piece of equipment or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a student with a disability. The term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of such a device. 



**Services** An assistive technology service is any service that directly assists the student with a disability in selecting, acquiring or using an assistive technology device. The term includes:



- Evaluating the needs of the student including a functional evaluation of the student in the student’s customary environment

- Purchasing, leasing, or otherwise providing assistive technology devices

- Coordination and using other therapies, interventions, or services with assistive technology devices, such as those associated with existing education and rehabilitation plans and programs

- Training or technical assistance for a student with a disability or, if appropriate, that student’s family

- Training or technical assistance for professionals (including individuals providing education or rehabilitation services), or other individuals who are substantially involved in the major life functions of students with disabilities
