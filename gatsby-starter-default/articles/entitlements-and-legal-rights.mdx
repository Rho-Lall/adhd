## Understanding "The Law"

Off the bat, the law isn't as straightforward as just reading  . .. . the law. I mean if you just read it, you'll understand it. Right?

That's not the case. There are three types of law you need to read up on to understand a law. There is statutory law, which is what I think of as the law as it's written. There's regulatory law which are the policies and procedures that need to be put in place to support the law though enforcement, guidance, that kind of a thing. Then there's case law. Until you're familiar with the statutory, regulatory, and case law related to a topic you don't understand the law. That is really helpful to know.


## Congressional Investigation of 1972

In 1972 Congress launched an investigation into the status of children with disabilities and
found that millions of children were not receiving an appropriate education:

>Yet, the most recent statistics provided by the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped estimated
that of the more than 8 million children . . .with handicapping conditions requiring special education
and related services, only 3.9 million such children are receiving an appropriate education. 1.75 million
handicapped children are receiving no educational services at all, and 2.5 million handicapped children
are receiving an inappropriate education.22

The investigation so moved members of Congress that they wrote:

>The long-range implications of these statistics are that public agencies and taxpayers will spend
billions of dollars over the lifetimes of these individuals to maintain such persons as dependents and
in a minimally acceptable lifestyle. With proper education services, many would be able to become
productive citizens, contributing to society instead of being forced to remain burdens. Others, through
such services, would increase their independence, thus reducing their dependence on society.

>There is no pride in being forced to receive economic assistance. Not only does this have negative
effects upon the handicapped person, but it has far-reaching effects for such person's family.

>Providing educational services will ensure against persons needlessly being forced into institutional
settings. One need only lookat public residential institutions to find thousands of persons whose families
are no longer able to care for them and who themselves have received no educational services. Billions of
dollars are expended each year to maintain persons in these subhuman conditionsâ€¦

>Parents of handicapped children all too frequently are not able to advocate the rights of their children
because they have been erroneously led to believe that their children will not be able to lead meaningful
lives . . . It should not . . . be necessary for parents throughout the country to continue utilizing the
courts to assure themselves a remedy. . .

In 1972, legislation was introduced in Congress after several "landmark court cases establishing in law the
right to education for all handicapped children."
