## Understanding "The Law"

The law is complex, and simply reading it won't be enough to understand it.

There are three kinds of law to be aware of in order to comprehend a law. Statutory law is what I think of as the actual law as written, the statute. There is also regulation: policies and procedures that must be implemented in order to enforce the statute. Then there is case law: how statutes and regulations are interpreted and enforced. You don't understand the law until you understand the statutory, regulatory, and case law connected with a subject.

## Congressional Investigation of 1972

In 1972, Congress initiated an inquiry into the status of children with disabilities and discovered that millions were not receiving a sufficient education:

>Yet, the most recent statistics provided by the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped estimated
that of the more than 8 million children . . .with handicapping conditions requiring special education
and related services, only 3.9 million such children are receiving an appropriate education. 1.75 million
handicapped children are receiving no educational services at all, and 2.5 million handicapped children
are receiving an inappropriate education.22

In reviewing the findings, members of Congress were so moved they wrote:

>The long-range implications of these statistics are that public agencies and taxpayers will spend
billions of dollars over the lifetimes of these individuals to maintain such persons as dependents and
in a minimally acceptable lifestyle. With proper education services, many would be able to become
productive citizens, contributing to society instead of being forced to remain burdens. Others, through
such services, would increase their independence, thus reducing their dependence on society.

>There is no pride in being forced to receive economic assistance. Not only does this have negative
effects upon the handicapped person, but it has far-reaching effects for such person's family.

>Providing educational services will ensure against persons needlessly being forced into institutional
settings. One need only lookat public residential institutions to find thousands of persons whose families
are no longer able to care for them and who themselves have received no educational services. Billions of
dollars are expended each year to maintain persons in these subhuman conditions…

>Parents of handicapped children all too frequently are not able to advocate the rights of their children
because they have been erroneously led to believe that their children will not be able to lead meaningful
lives . . . It should not . . . be necessary for parents throughout the country to continue utilizing the
courts to assure themselves a remedy. . .

In 1972, legislation was introduced in Congress after several "landmark court cases establishing in law the
right to education for all handicapped children."

## Your Rights in a Nutshell

The IDEA includes safeguards to protect your right(s) to:

- participate in all meetings
- examine all educational records
- obtain an independent educational evaluation (IEE) of your children

## Resolving Disputes

Be at ease and confident in challenging the IEP team and provide your rationale for doing so. Disagreement is not harmful; it allows the team to identify underlying issues and creativity in coming up with solutions. When attention is focused on the student and meeting his or her demands, we see progress. Keep an open mind. Consideration of various options can only be a benefit.

> Collaborating through positive communication fosters productive meetings. Be ready to bargain and remain open-minded. As your child goes through the public school system, you'll most likely work with the same professionals for many years. Keep that in mind.

School districts operate through a chain of command. The majority of resolution techniques follow a procedure or chain of command. Problems typically rise to the next level in the chain to be resolved. Standard bureaucracy. In addition to the chain of command, informal supports are available to assist parents and schools work through difficulties, without the stigma of "an escalation". It is preferable to address issues at the lowest feasible level.

Informal supports available to parents and schools include:

- Parent-to-Parent Assistance
- Intermediary
- Facilitation

IDEA also provides guidance on formal processes and procedures for resolving disputes. The formal supports available to parents include:

- Mediation
- Formal State Complaint
- Due Process Hearing

## Following the Chain of Command

Follow the chain of command when seeking assistance in the educational system. If you can't resolve issues with a teacher, request that the teacher goes with you to the next level, usually the principal. Most problems are solved at this level. If you cannot work things out with the principal,  follow your school district's chain of command. I've bulleted the key members in the chain of command starting at the top and working down the chain:

- Utah State Board of Education School Board Member
- Utah State Board of Education Special Education Department
- School District Superintendent
- School District Special Education Director
- Principle
- Teacher

## How Do I Communicate My Concerns?

Challenges will present themselves at various moments. Establish good communication channels early. Be open and clear with the professionals that work with your child. Be friendly but remember they are not your friends. Be professional.

Writing down your thoughts can help clarify your specific needs and concerns as well as articulate them succinctly.

Here are some tips so you can get your message across effectively: 

- If it isn't written down, it didn't happen. Write it down!
- Information that is in writing becomes part of the permanent record.
- Open with something positive about your child’s program and then move on to your concern.
- Keep your message short and to the point. 
- Discuss one issue at a time.
- Send the message to all parties involved (general education teacher, special education teacher, principal, therapist, etc.).
- Be reasonable in the response time that a professional might take to reply. 
- Don’t overwhelm the team with numerous emails.
- Avoid negative exchanges via email. If a conversation is needed, set up a meeting. 
- Provide your contact information and times when you can be reached. 

> Consider the attitude and preconceptions you bring to your interactions with the school. Consider taking a "clean slate" approach to new problems and challenges. Begin with the assumption that everyone involved has the best of intentions.

## Informal Dispute Resolution
The IDEA provides certain supports in the event of a dispute with the school district. These are known as "formal" options. Each state, however, has its own set of resources accessible to families beyond the formal options. Utah offers three distinct "informal" options for families to take advantage of, including parent-to-parent assistance, an intermediary, and IEP meeting facilitation.



> The Utah Parent Center (UPC) has varying levels of support for families with varying levels of need. These services are provided at no cost to parents. 

### PARENT-TO-PARENT ASSISTANCE
UPC Parent Consultants are available for consultation, problem-solving, and support in the IEP process for parents throughout the state. These knowledgeable individuals provide training and resources on a variety of disability-related topics. Families can call the UPC's main phone line to access all other Parent Consultants or to inquire about a district consultant. 



Parent advocates encourage and assist parents in navigating and resolving disputes with ongoing communication and collaboration with the school district. This level of support is characterized by: 

- More intensive communication, including frequent check-ins with parents

- Document review and discussions with the purpose of gaining an in-depth understanding of the information and helping frame questions

- Meeting attendance, including eligibility meetings, IEP meetings, transition meetings, and other meetings along the special education continuum of formal and informal dispute resolution, as needed. 



### INTERMEDIARY
An intermediary from the Utah State Board of Education (USBE) can be requested by the parent. The intermediary can help clarify issues via telephone call or may use other electronic means to provide knowledge and state regulation information to parents and school district personnel.



The intermediary might refer the family to other informal ways of resolving issues and, if appropriate, may also proceed with resolving the situation. 

### FACILITATORS 
**Sponsored by the LEA.** Some of the LEAs throughout the state offer this option, and they are able to bring in a facilitator that is not part of the IEP team to assist with the team dynamics and to help the team move forward. Facilitators have expertise in effective listening and speaking skills, and their participation can be a positive experience for the entire team. 



**Sponsored by the USBE.** In Utah there is a group of trained, impartial, problem-solving, facilitators who are available to give support in the IEP process. These facilitators help IEP teams communicate effectively. Their purpose is to help parties work through problems before they escalate and become more difficult, expensive and time-consuming. The help of an IEP Facilitator can be requested by either the parent or the school. Since this is a voluntary option for IEP teams, both the parent and the LEA must agree to facilitator participation. The facilitator can be requested through the Utah Parent Center (UPC) or the Utah State Board of Education (USBE) and will be paid for at public expense, without any direct cost to parents or LEAs.

### How do I know which of these informal supports is right for me?
When in doubt about what support is most appropriate for your particular situation, call the Utah Parent Center (UPC) for an individualized consultation provided at no cost to you. Parent Consultants are themselves parents of individuals with disabilities. They can provide more in-depth information about each of these supports and other information that may be relevant to you.

## FORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION
### MEDIATION 
The USBE maintains a list of qualified and impartial mediators that are trained in effective mediation techniques and special education law. Mediation is voluntary, so both the parent and the LEA must agree to participate in the process. The process is at no cost to the parents nor the school district. All discussions that take place during mediation remain confidential. 

### FORMAL STATE COMPLAINT
A complaint is an allegation that the law is not being followed. If negotiation doesn’t resolve the conflict, you can file a complaint in writing to the USBE Director of Special Education. A complaint must be filed no more than one (1) year from the violation. A copy of the complaint must be sent to the school district’s Special Education Director or the charter school administrator. If parents or adult students are unable to file in writing, they can contact the local school district or charter school or the USBE for assistance. Allegations may be made by public agencies, private individuals or organizations.



**Timeline Information.** Unless there are exceptional circumstances, as a general rule, the Utah State Director of Special Education shall resolve the complaint within 60 calendar days and issue a written decision of findings and remedies to both parent and school district or charter school. The complaint decision issued by the USBE is the final action and is not subject to appeal. If either party disagrees, a Due Process complaint can be filed.



The result of a successful mediation is a legally binding agreement. A written and signed mediation agreement is enforceable in any state court or district court of the United States. Mediation may not deny or delay the parent’s or adult student’s right to a due process hearing or deny any other rights.

### What must be included in a state complaint?
- A statement that the LEA or public agency has violated a requirement of Part B of IDEA or the Utah State Board of Education Special Education Rules

- The facts on which the statement is based

- The contact information and signature of the person making the complaint 



When regarding a specific student:

- Student’s name, address, and school attending

- The contact information and signature of the person making the complaint

- A description and nature of the problem

- A proposed resolution to the problem



If you decide to proceed with a due process hearing, it is recommended you have some legal help. A due process hearing is a formal legal proceeding where an attorney is usually used. Try all forms of mediation before considering a due process hearing, but do not be afraid to advocate for your own and your child’s rights.

## DUE PROCESS HEARING
Parents may file a due process complaint (different from a formal state complaint) requesting an impartial due process hearing on any of the matters relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the student, or the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the student. A copy of the due process complaint must be sent to the USBE. Under some circumstances, a school distric may also request a hearing. Persons with special expertise, including attorneys and advocates, may assist or accompany either party to a due process hearing. 

### Additional Considerations
- You can expect to be able to have the student present for the hearing, to have the hearing open to the public, and to receive findings and decisions at no cost to you.

- The decision at the hearing is final unless appealed in civil action.

- Under certain circumstances, an expedited hearing can be requested and granted.

- There are special considerations regarding attorney’s fees for both parties.

- The student will remain in the last agreed-upon educational placement, unless both parties agree otherwise.

### What is a resolution meeting?
**Within 15 calendar days** of receiving notice of the parents’ or adult student’s due process complaint and prior to initiating a hearing, the school district or charter school must convene a meeting with them and other relevant members of the IEP team who have specific knowledge of the facts (not including an attorney of the district or charter unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney). The purpose of the meeting is for the parents or adult student to discuss their complaint and the facts of the complaint so that the district or charter has the opportunity to resolve the dispute. The resolution meeting does not need to be held if the parents or adult student and the district or charter agree in writing to waive the meeting or to use the mediation process. **If the issue is not resolved within 30 days, the due process hearing would take place.**
