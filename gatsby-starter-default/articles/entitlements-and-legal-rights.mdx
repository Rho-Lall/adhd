## Understanding "The Law"

Off the bat, the law isn't as straightforward as just reading  . .. . the law. I mean if you just read it, you'll understand it. Right?

That's not the case. There are three types of law you need to read up on to understand a law. There is statutory law, which is what I think of as the law as it's written. There's regulatory law which are the policies and procedures that need to be put in place to support the law though enforcement, guidance, that kind of a thing. Then there's case law. Until you're familiar with the statutory, regulatory, and case law related to a topic you don't understand the law. That is really helpful to know.
