ADHD is largely genetic. A child with ADHD often has at least one parent with ADHD – and all of the emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and executive function challenges that go with it. This double (or triple, or quadruple, or…) dose of ADHD can complicate the parent-child relationship, and those complications typically manifest differently with mothers vs. fathers. This is true even when a parent doesn’t have the condition.

For fathers who have ADHD, difficulties with parenting might surface when their child’s ADHD causes academic or behavioral challenges that remind them of their own difficulties growing up — and/or of their own parents’ harsh responses to those difficulties at a time when ADHD was not well understood. For fathers without ADHD, understanding their child’s thinking and behavior might pose an even bigger challenge.

In this webinar, fathers with and without ADHD will:

- Discover ways to manage your own stress so you can set a calmer tone at home
- Explore approaches to improve your relationship with your child
- Learn strategies to help your child get things done and fulfill their responsibilities
- Distinguish between a reason and an excuse when looking at how ADHD affects your child
- Learn to determine when to accommodate your child’s struggles, and when to encourage them to push through
