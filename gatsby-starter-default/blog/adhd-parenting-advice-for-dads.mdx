ADHD is largely genetic. A child with ADHD often has at least one parent with ADHD – and all of the emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and executive function challenges that go with it. This double (or triple, or quadruple, or…) dose of ADHD can complicate the parent-child relationship, and those complications typically manifest differently with mothers vs. fathers. This is true even when a parent doesn’t have the condition.

For fathers who have ADHD, difficulties with parenting might surface when their child’s ADHD causes academic or behavioral challenges that remind them of their own difficulties growing up — and/or of their own parents’ harsh responses to those difficulties at a time when ADHD was not well understood. For fathers without ADHD, understanding their child’s thinking and behavior might pose an even bigger challenge.


##  Traditional Expectations of Masculinity in an ADHD Frame

**Independance and Self Sufficiency.** Our world is not as independent as it used to be. We live in a world that is increasingly interdependant. ADHD elemetary students and the adults they grow up to be shine in a team environment. They struggle with the minutia of day to day tasks and responsibilities.  

**Physical Prowess.** Strength, coordination, etc. ADHD affects coordination and the ability to execute physical tasks.

**Tough & Resilient.** Neurodivergent folks are tough and resiliant but that well of resilience is used up managing our brain functionining to "mask" and appear nero-typical.

**Intelectual, Logical, Emotionally Restricted.** Often ADHD and giftedness go hand in hand, but not always. ADHD affects the executive functioning around emotional self-regulation.

**Financial Success.** Men are expected to be providers. The challenges students with ADHD face do not go away once they enter the workforce. ADHD creates challenges in the cubicle culture. 

## Ways to manage your own stress so you can set a calmer tone at home

Everyone has some degree of stress, no one is at 0. There is a baseline level of anxiety. The higher our baseline is the sooner we hit that fight or flight response.

SHRED. Sleep Habits Relationships Diet. We need to pay attention to the basics. Spend time on self care.

## Explore approaches to improve your relationship with your child

Don't jump to fixing the problem. Default to validate and listen. Forgive first. Then we can move to colaborating on a fix.

Connecting with our kids. There are bids for connection. A bid is any effort to get attention, affirmation, connection. It can be anything: sitting next to you, taping you on the shoulder, inviting you to play catch, waving to say hi, making you a meal, etc. We want to turn towards that bid. You may not always be able to comply but you can turn towards it and acknowledge it. Don't ignore them. Do activities together. 

## Learn strategies to help your child get things done and fulfill their responsibilities

Communicate your own stress escalation. It's ok to communicate that your are becoming more and more fustrated. It's ok to communicate that if you repeat yourself one more time you are going to loose it. Let people know when they are "driving your bananas." Hiding emotions is not emotional intelligence.

## Distinguish between a reason and an excuse when looking at how ADHD affects your child

ADHD is not an excuse but it is a reason. An excuse is a justification that i don't have to feel bad or do anything to fix my mistake or clean up my mess. A reason is gives understanding about why the mistake happened and releases us from negative emotional baggage, guilt and shame, related to the mistake. We know it's the ADHD and we can move on and fix the mistake because i'm still responsible. The difference is internalizing the belief that this is who i am vs acknowledging a mistake.

The alternative is guilt and shame, i'm aweful and i suck at life.

## Learn to determine when to accommodate your child’s struggles, and when to encourage them to push through

Manage your feelings. Your feelings are your, not your kid's responsibility. If your kids bring up triggers and emotions then you have work to do. Do it.

ADHD students do not develop at the same rate as their neuro-typical peers. That delay can be anywhere from 1 to 3 years. So a 7th grader might have the maturity of a 5th grader. Be mindful that ADHD is a developmental disorder. That affects their ability to perform.

Set clear expectations. Be clear on values. Set expectations. For example, create as much as you consume. Meet them where they are, then raise the expectation a little to stretch them. Help them break down tasks into chunks.
